Immediately you hear an inner voice say: Well, since you turned to me and I want to convert, enter the church: the door will no longer closed for you. She did penance in church then return before the image of Mary. \"My sovereign, here I am at your orders; where you want me to do penance? - depart, cross the Jordan, and find the place of your rest,\" She retired to the desert of Transjordan, which was found by two disciples of St. Cyriac.",

        "description": "Isaac fled to Italy from his native Syria to escape life under the Monophysite heretics who denied that Christ had two natures (divine and human). Upon arriving in Spoleto, he obtained permission to remain in one of the city’s churches after dark in order to pray in the quiet of the night. He continued thus in prayer for three days and nights until a sacristan of the church, jealous of his piety, accused him of hypocrisy, struck him, and drove him away. The ill-tempered sacristan then fell under demonic possession. St. Isaac had stretched himself upon the body of his assailant. \"Isaac is driving me out !\" exclaimed the evil spirit, thus disclosing to the inhabitants of Spoleto the identity of the stranger. It was only through Isaac’s prayers that the demon was finally expelled. The townsfolk, convinced that they had in their midst a very holy man, offered him presents and would have built him a monastery, but he refused all gifts and retired to a cave on Monte Luco to live as a hermit. In his solitude he experienced a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who instructed him to begin accepting followers to be trained in the religious life. Isaac subsequently established at Mount Luco a laura, a community of hermits, each living in his own cell, but regularly assembling for divine worship. He served as the community’s abbot. Saint Gregory the Great speaks of Isaac’s penchant for humor in sometimes yielding to “extreme joviality.” All that we know of St. Isaac is derived from the third book of the Dialogues of St. Gregory.",

Two years later the bishop of Clermont retired permanently in the abbey of Manlieu, where he died in 710. According to some uplifting stories of the thirteenth century, St.. Bonet saw the Virgin in 684 or 700, while praying alone in a church dedicated to St Michael. Sausseret reprints the facts reported in the bottom of a letter: \"the guards closed the doors. St. Bonit, full of joy for a chance to give free rein to his mercy from that moment, lay prostrate on the floor of the bathroom of the temple with his tears. But as soon as he had been in this position, you feel suddenly come down from heaven and filled with the sounds of harmony. He saw, at the same time, all heavenly choirs fill the sacred area with this light and enter a multitude that his faith had blessed him with. There were, in fact, legions of angels and saints, who composed a the procession for their Queen, mother of Jesus Christ, who appeared after them, seated on a throne carried by seraphim and similar to a queen that a large honor guard precedes and accompanies [...] All these immortal beings continued along the main nave and when they came in front of 'main altar, some of them asked who among them would say the mass. Then the Blessed Virgin spoke up and said, 'Here Bonit, we seek you my faithful servant and excellent bishop, and worthy of fulfilling this holy function \" Some blessed then, obeying the order that she had just given detachment from others and went to the holy bishop who was trembling. Taken by the hand,he accompanied the choir. The saints clothed him in a pontifical ornaments and then he began to say mass with glorified beings as assistants [...] When Mass was over, the Holy Virgin, left him.>> (I, 118-120).

Fallen into a deep sleep, all three had the same dream: the Virgin showed them a model of a chapel and begged them to build one in her honor that place. So it was that they decided to build the altar in a church setting where the dogwood grew. Hearing about the miracle, Pope Gregory II went there and May 10 of that year, and consecrated the altar of the church.",

According to legends that have spread from the end of the fourteenth century, he would have converted after a miraculous vision of a deer wearing a light cross between its horns. This story, in fact, comes from an early Christian text from the second century, told by a Roman officer, Eucstachio, who was martyred under the Emperor Trajan (23-117). The legend of the animal \"Crucifer\" was adapted from John of Damascus in the seventh century, then taken up by Jacopo da Varazze, in his Golden Legend (1261-1266). Bibliography: P.

        "description": "In 934, St. Eberhard of Strasbourg, arrived and set about building a large monastery and Church, the latter enclosing and protecting the hermit and martyr Meinrad's holy little chapel, which was only eight and a half yards long by six yards wide. When this work was completed in the summer of 948, Eberhard, having become the first Abbot of Einsiedeln, invited St. Konrad, the Bishop of Konstanz, to consecrate and dedicate the Chapel of Our Lady of the Hermits. St. Konrad's party, which included the Bishop of Augsburg and many princes and knights of the German Empire, arrived at the hermitage in the Dark Wood, on the eve of the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. The holy Bishop of Konstanz retired to his room early in the evening in order to rest after the trip. However, despite his fatigue, he did not fail to get up, as was his custom, before midnight, and to go with several religious to pray in the chapel which he was due to consecrate the next morning. While he was fervently beseeching the Blessed Virgin to accept this holy shrine and to make it henceforth a center of pilgrimages where for centuries and centuries she would heal and help her suffering children, suddenly, at exactly midnight, St. Konrad and those with him began to hear the sound of many harmonious voices, chanting a melody of heavenly beauty. Looking up, he saw with amazement that the sanctuary of the chapel was filled with a brilliant light that made everything clearer than the brightest noonday sun, and that the altar was completely illuminated as for a solemn festival. Then he saw coming down from Heaven a magnificent procession of Angels under the leadership of St. Michael the Archangel. Some of them formed the choir and were chanting celestial psalms, while others bearing swinging golden censers took their places before the altar. After the angels came St. Peter, St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke, and St. John, St. Gregory, St. Augustine and St. Ambrose. Then came, vested as deacon and subdeacon, the Martyr-Saints Lawrence and Stephen. And finally, as High Priest, arrayed in pontifical vestments and wearing a violet chasuble, there appeared in all the splendor of His Divinity, Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Then, as a breathtaking climax, just before God the Son began the Mass that was to consecrate this holy shrine forever to His Immaculate Mother, Mary herself took her place above the altar of her chapel, radiant with dazzling glory and attended by her train of angelic spirits! In speechless awe, St. Konrad followed every detail of this extraordinary Mass. He observed with rapt attention that the solemn ceremony was performed in the minutest particulars according to the ritual prescribed by the Church for the consecration of a temple, except that, at the Sanctus, the angels sang: \"Holy God, have mercy on us in the court of the Glorious Virgin! Blessed be the Son of Mary Who has come to this place and Who is to reign for ages of ages!\" More than an hour later, having formally dedicated the shrine to His Blessed Mother under the title of Our Lady of the Hermits, the King of Kings returned in all His majesty to Heaven with His distinguished company of Saints and Angels. The beautiful living Virgin vanished too, leaving in her place the lovely statue. The singing ceased. The bright light was magically extinguished. And soon the newly consecrated shrine was, to all outward appearances, exactly as it had been before. The saintly Bishop of Konstanz, however, remained kneeling for hours in ecstatic meditation over the marvels which he had just witnessed. Later that morning, when all the dignitaries had assembled, and after he had kept them waiting quite a while, he was politely informed that it was time for him to begin the dedication ceremony. Still deeply moved, he firmly declared that the chapel had already been miraculously consecrated by God Himself during the night. But when the Abbot Eberhard and the other officials refused to accept this story, and insisted that the ceremony for which so many persons had come together should start at once, St. Konrad yielded. Then another striking supernatural intervention took place: as the Bishop put his foot on the first altar step, the great Church was suddenly filled with a strong and impressive voice which everyone present heard exclaim three times: \"Stop! Stop, Brother! This Chapel has been Divinely consecrated!\" Later on, a full investigation of these extraordinary events was undertaken by the highest civil and ecclesiastical authorities, and in the year 964, in the presence of the German Emperor Otto and of St. Konrad the Bishop, His Holiness Pope Leo VIII issued a bull confirming the miraculous dedication.",

        "description": "Santa Maria della Petrara is the mother church of the town of Castelnuovo di Conza in the province of Salerno in the region of Campania in southwest Italy.* It succeeded the Church of San Nicola around the tenth century. The site of present-day Castelnuovo dates back to antiquity. The name “Petrara” stems from an ancient village perched on a promontory with caverns and caves. The legend of Castelnuovo recounts that the Blessed Mother appeared to a Cantelnovese man or woman on the path and asked for a piece of ‘unfit’ bread. It is said the person went to his/her house and took a piece of leaven dough ‘smeared with oil or paste’ and offered it to the Madonna. It is said that the Lady asked that an image of her be placed in a church built on the spot. A statue was crafted depicting the Madonna with a piece of bread in her hand, a genuine product of the earth. So was born the image of Madonna delle Colture and the church of Santa Maria della Petrara, a title by which Our Lady is also known, as well as Maria della Petrara. The title is also quite popular in Syria where she is commemorated annually on January 15th. *Not far from Castelnuovo is the Benedictine monastery of St. Menna that plays prominently in the town’s early history. Castelnuovo was hit by the earthquake of January 14, 1466, and was at the epicenter of the earthquake of November 23, 1980.",

        "description": "Peter the Hesychast Aghiorita settled on the holy mountain in 681. Peter was a greek who was a soldier in the imperial court in Constantinople. After being a prisoner of the Arabs voted for the monastic life and went to Rome. One night he dreamed the Blessed Virgin Mary who told him that Mount Athos would become a monastic center. Guided by the mystical force of this vision, Peter went on the holy mountain where he lived for fifty years, until his death in a cave. Abraham, who in 952 took the name of Athanasius, is considered the founder of monasticism cenobite on Mount Athos, was born in 925-30. in Trabzon on the Black Sea coast in his long stay in Constantinople, he had the opportunity to make friends with the brothers Leo and Nicephorus Phocas. In 957, under a pseudonym, Athanasius settled on Mount Athos with an old hermit. He lived as a hermit in a first time and faced heavy temptations. One day the Virgin appeared to him and lifted him from these difficulties, consoling him and exhorting him not to leave the Mount and not fail in his monastic vocation. Inspired by this apparition, Athanasius devoted himself with greater zeal to understand the significance of its spiritual mission. Some time later, supported by the emperor,he beca,e the first superior of this monastery, which was established according to the Benedictine rule. Laurentin, Rene and Sbalchiero, Patrick.

Un des seigneurs des Pouilles, le comte Guevara d’Ariano l’aurait vue d’abord en songe dans un faisceau de lumière. Le songe devient réalité lorsqu’il est inspiré d’aller à la chasse dans le bois. Il y voit la lumière qui le fait tomber et s’agenouiller au pied du chêne. Une voix lui dit : « Mon enfant, je suis la Mère de Dieu et je veux que me soit érigée une chapelle pour y être vénérée par les fidèles pour qui je demande à Dieu beaucoup de grâces. » La lumière disparaît mais rayonne toujours de l’arbre, et le comte aperçoit alors la statue couronnée. Aussitôt après, un paysan nommé Strazzacappa, qui fait paître ses bœufs, s’approche du chêne et s’agenouille. Il prend une caldaietta, y verse de l’huile, la suspend à un rameau en guise de lampe et l’allume en l’honneur de la Madone. L’huile aurait duré miraculeusement durant de nombreuses années sans qu’on la renouvelle. Le seigneur fait édifier une chapelle dont les vestiges demeurent sous l’autel de l’église actuelle.</p>\r\n<p>La découverte de la statue et sa date immémoriale (avril 1001) constituent le fond historique solide, mais la statue actuelle remonte seulement au XIIe siècle : la grande époque des Vierges romanes, assises sur un trône avec l’Enfant Jésus dans les bras. Elle est placée au fond du sanctuaire, majestueuse dans une attitude maternelle et accueillante, les bras ouverts. Mais les bras primitifs étaient étranges car l’Enfant Jésus avait disparu. La « restitution du Fils à la Mère » fut accomplie le 24 mai 1987 lors de la venue de Jean Paul II. Le pape posa la statue de l’enfant entre les bras de la Vierge devant une foule de 30 000 pèlerins, qui accompagnèrent le rite d’une longue acclamation. La statue de l’enfant est récente (réalisée en mars 1987 par la « ditta Atelier »), mais conforme au type ancien bien connu.</p>\r\n<p>René LAURENTIN et Patrick SBALCHIERO article « Foggia », dans : René LAURENTIN et Patrick SBALCHIERO, Dictionnaire encyclopédique des apparitions de la Vierge.

Curious of the occurrence,he follows it, and came into the town of Conche, where he realizes that the dove has ordered the chips and wood chips so as to trace the perimeter of a building. Looking up, Costanzo sees a Lady with the Child in her arms, lifted up on the perimeter marked by the dove, which, with motherly smile, points to the track. Therefore he builds in that place the church as proof of his conversion and his love for the Virgin. He erected the church and convent, and there has been a rush of pilgrims from all over to implore the protection and the graces of Our Lady of Mercy.

Countless were the Christians sacrificed on the alter of Revolution, especially in Paris, where the tireless work of the guillotine filled the street gutters with rivers of human blood. Trouble had come to the countryside as well. Already at the beginning of the century, the greed of the secular landlord of Fontgombault had chased away all but five monks. By this time, at the end of the century, not a single monk was left to sing the Divine Praises. Theayor of the village of Fontgombault had begun to sell the very stones of the Abbey walls (July 2, 1791). But the work of destruction was not yet complete. It was about this time that an impious hand sought to destroy the statue of Mary above the northern door of the church. He positioned a ladder and climbed up in order to carry out the practice, quite common with the revolutionaries, of breaking off the head and members of a piece of art that offended him and the new ideas of those who had no more need of God and His Saints. As he swung his hammer, however, he suddenly lost his balance and fell off the ladder, hurting himself mortally when he hit the ground far below. As he lay dying, the poor man regretted in an instant the evil deed he had done and begged God, through the intercession of the Virgin Mother of God whom he had so gravely offended, to forgive him. Such was his change of heart, his conversion at the moment of death, that the witnesses recognized in the event a special grace from heaven. From that moment on the statue has been known as Our Lady of a Happy Death.",

The apparition added that the four women responsible for the public disorder must do penance. She asked John to leave his spade near the fountain where she assured him that the water would be good. When he came back to recuperate it, he would find a \"sign\" on the end of the handle. John ran quickly home to the farm and asked his brother and sister to go back and retrieve his spade. The youngsters found it \"standing straight up with three cross-shaped oak leaves coming out of the top of the handle.\" The four women made reparation for their wrongs and people went in procession to the place of the miracle. In early July, the Virgin appeared a second time to John, in his bedroom. \"You did what I asked you to do well, and the fountain will be good; the people have corrected themselves well,\" she told him. A commission of inquiry has identified twenty-eight cures from the water of the fountain. In October 1686, a second inquiry mentioned seven new cases. The chapel of Pla-Rouzaud was built by the poor villagers and blessed on September 8, 1695 by Monsignor de Verthamon. The renown of the shrine Our Lady of Celles spread widely and attracted believers from the entire region and even from Spain. The pilgrimage, which takes place to this day at the restored shrine on the third Sunday of July, is marked by evangelical simplicity and Marian humility.

On this mountain, after some long pilgrimages, William of Vercelli retired permanently in prayer , then St. William (1085-1142). He renounced his father's property to have the freedom of a spiritual life. With the passage of time, he joined other hermits and founded the Congregation of Benedictine hermits, also called the Guglielmini (white robes of the Order and the Benedictine rule). One day, during his long meditation, William was called by the Holy Virgin (1085) to erect a shrine where a pagan deity was first venerated. The shrine has since the seventeenth century has held an old painting of the Madonna \"Comforter of the afflicted\" (regal and contemplative expression, probably from Constantinople).",

Hoping at all costs to make them apostatize, he went so far as to send his remarkably beautiful daughter to seduce them. But while discussing the Gospel with the prisoners, believing she would defeat them, Ismenia was defeated. She asked the knights to carve the image of Mary for her. The knights prayed to the Blessed Virgin so that she would guide their hands. During the night, the Virgin sent angels bearing her radiant image of piety. The next day, when Ismenia returned the dungeon was filled with dazzling light and a delicious perfume exuded from the statue. The princess believed immediately and took the statue to her apartments, never taking her eyes off the statue while the knights cried out: Our Lady of Liesse! The following night, Ismenia heard the statue say: \"Trust me, Ismenia! I have prayed to my Son for you. You will be his faithful servant. You will free my three beloved knights. You will be baptized and through you, France will be enriched by countless graces. Through you my name will become famous and later, I will receive you forever in paradise.\" Ismenia helped the prisoners escape and fled with them. All four of them were overtaken by a deep sleep, and during their sleep angels transported them to France. When they awoke, the three knights were in their country, near their castle in Marchais. Ismenia was baptized and they all agreed to have a chapel built at the site where they had woken up, in honor of Our Lady of Liesse. Since then miracles have been countless. Louis VII came as a pilgrim in 1146 and Our Lady of Liesse became a favorite pilgrimage destination of the kings of France.",

        "description": "Hildegard of Bingen was born the tenth and last child of noble parents. When she was eight years old Hildegard was sent to a Benedictine monastery to be educated an. In 1116 she became a nun there and twenty years later she was made the head of the monastery. From her early childhood Hildegard had visions, but soon realized she was unique in this ability and hid the gift for many years. However, in 1141, she had a series of visions in which God gave her instant understanding of the meaning of the religious texts. God commanded Hildegard to write down everything she observed in the visions and she devoted the next ten years doing this (including 26 drawings of things she had seen during the visions). In a vision, Hildegard saw the universe as a cosmic egg surrounded by flames, which represents God burning everywhere. In the center is air full of water, giving moisture to the entire egg. In the globe, a mountain divides darkness from light. When experiencing a vision, Hildegard would see a bright light - more brilliant than a cloud over the sun - inside which an even brighter light which she called \"the living light\" sometimes appeared. But she didnt see the visions with her bodily eyes, which remained open, but in her soul. She also claimed to hear words, spoken in Latin. As news of her visions began to spread and gain fame, Pope Eugenius III decided to sent a commission to inquire into her work. This commission found her teaching orthodox and her insights authentic, and reported so to the Pope, who sent her a letter of approval. Hildegard of Bingen has been called one of the most important figures in the history of the Middle Ages and was a woman of many extraordinary and diverse talents. Besides being the abbess of a large and influential Benedictine abbey, she was a prominent preacher, healer, scientist, and artist as well as a composer and theologian, writing nine books on theology, medicine, science, and physiology, as well as 70 poems and an opera. During a time when few women were accorded respect, Hildegard was consulted by and advised bishops, popes and kings, and spoke out openly against corruption in the church. She was made a Doctor of the Church by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012.Source: Livingmiracles.net",

The first night they rested at a certain village, where Abbot John had the following vision in a dream. It seemed to him that he was in the monastery at Byland when he saw a Lady, nobly dressed, and of surpassing beauty, holding by Her left hand a little Boy, who plucked a bough from a little tree that stood in the center of the cloister quadrangle, and then they both vanished. After this the abbot and monks set forth, but not knowing their way, the abbot proposed that they should recite their Office. Having done so, the Lady and Her Son re-appeared, and the abbot begged Her to lead them to Joreval. Then looking at Her Son, She said, \"Sweetest Son, for the love Thou hast ever had for Me, be a guide to these brethren.\" Then the Child held out the branch He had picked from the cloister of Byland, and said, \"Follow Me,\" and they did so, walking through rough and hard ways without any difficulty. And a number of little birds, snowy white, flew down on to the bough the Child held, and there sang the hymn, Benedicite omnia opera Domini Domino, whereby they were much refreshed, and at last they reached a wild uncultivated spot, where the Child planted His branch in the earth with the birds singing upon it, and said, \"Here God will soon be invoked and adored.\" And it seemed as though the whole land grew into a great tree covered with white singing birds. Then the Child disappeared. Abbot John then awoke, and with his companions proceeded on his journey much consoled. The monks were all clothed in white, and everyone asked, \"Who are all these men in white going by?\" Then Abbot John heard one reply: \"They are monks moving from Byland to Joreval.\" Another gazed at the firmament and stars for a while, and then, as if he had received a revelation, said, \"These good monks have come at a happy moment; they will, within a brief space, attain to much prosperity, and have abundance of all things necessary.\" Abbot John was much rejoiced at these words and proceeded on his way. This legend was known to everyone in those parts and often retold.",

After her death she was buried in the abbey church of St. Florin. When her writings were published the name of saint was added. She was never formally canonized, but in 1584 her name was entered in the Roman Martyrology and has remained there. Given to works of piety from her youth, much afflicted with bodily and mental suffering, a zealous observer of the Rule of St. Benedict and of the regulation of her convent, and devoted to practices of mortification, Elizabeth was favoured, from 1152, with ecstasies and visions of various kinds. These generally occurred on Sundays and Holy Days at Mass or Divine Office or after hearing or reading the lives of saints. Christ, His Blessed Mother, an angel, or the special saint of the day would appear to her and instruct her; or she would see quite realistic representations of the Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension, or other scenes of the Old and New Testaments. What she saw and heard she put down on wax tablets. Her abbot, Hildelin, told her to relate these things to her brother Egbert (Eckebert), then priest at the church of Bonn. At first she hesitated fearing lest she be deceived or be looked upon as a deceiver; but she obeyed. Egbert (who became a monk of Schönau in 1155 and succeeded Hildelin as second abbot) put everything in writing, later arranged the material at leisure, and then published all under his sister's name.",

Not many shrines can claim as many ex-votos of so many different nationalities as Mariazell. In an area torn by national strife and centuries-old feuds, such a phenomenon is extraordinary indeed. In 1157, a Benedictine monk named Magnus, taking a small statue of the Madonna and Child, retired into the wilderness, where tradition says the dense trees parted to make way for him. A little chapel was built around a linden tree, the origin of the shrine. Pilgrims as far back as the 15th century attest they have seen the Madonna’s face, eyes and lips moving, as if she were alive. The present structure was erected in the 17th century. The middle spire of the Church is of Gothic design, while the outer spires are Baroque. Many of the pilgrims to Maria Zell perform the same penance up the main stairway. On their knees, arms outstretched, or carrying heavy blocks of stone, the devout faithful advance; sometimes the procession halts while all prostrate themselves on the ground. Person who are unable to make the pilgrimage write letters to the Madonna, which are preserved in the archives. According to the ancient custom they are addressed: \"To Our Beloved Mother of Grace.\" See also: Mariazell (1371)",

        "description": "A poor carpenter of Le Puy, named Durand, claimed to have had an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In this vision he received a paper on which there was a representation of the Blessed Virgin seated on a throne with a figure of the child Jesus in her hands, and bearing the inscription, \"Lamb of God who takest away the sins of the world give us peace\". An association was to be formed whose members should bind themselves to keep and procure peace and, as distinctive signs, wear a white hood and a medal bearing a reproduction of the picture and inscription. Durand met with astounding success in the execution of these instructions. A confraternity was organized under the direction of the clergy exactly on the lines of Catholic confraternities of the present day. The Church of Our, Lady of Le Puy became the center of the movement, which spread with extraordinary rapidity over the provinces of France, south of the Loire. The Capuciati, in addition to pledging themselves not to swear falsely, not to blaspheme, not to play dice, enter taverns, or wear costly garments, also promised to do all in their power to restore and maintain peace. Their endeavors in this line were not ineffectual, an overwhelming defeat which the \"Routiers\", or undisciplined bands of soldiery of the period, sustained in 1183 must be largely ascribed to the cooperation of the Capuciati with the royal army. The existence of the confraternity was of short duration. Its disappearance is involved in obscurity; but it seems to have directed its efforts against the members of the nobility, and to have been wiped out of existence by them, aided by the \"Routiers\". Its advocacy of heretical principles is not clearly and trustworthily indicated in historical records. The accusation that it respected neither ecclesiastical nor civil authority may perhaps be explained by its resistance to real or imagined abuses of power.",

        "description": "<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Mariazell est le sanctuaire marial le plus ancien de l'Autriche et le plus important pèlerinage de l'Europe centrale. Ses origines remontent à 1157, quand un moine bénédictin, Magnus, du couvent de S. Lamberto, fut envoyé dans cette région par son abbé pour y prêcher l'évangile.</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">Le moine portait avec lui une statue de la Sainte Vierge en bois de tilleul, qu’il offrait à la vénération des fidèles dans une petite cellule monastique, « zell », d’où le nom « Mariazell ».</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">La sainteté du moine, la présence de la statue et les miracles attirèrent les populations de l'Europe centrale et orientale. En 1200 on construisit la première église.</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">Depuis lors Mariazell a été invoqué comme « Mère des slaves ». Le roi Louis le Grand, de Hongrie, après sa victoire glorieuse sur les Turcs, en 1370, fit édifier comme ex-voto la « Chapelle des Grâces » où l’on vénère l'ancienne statue.</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">En 1380, l'église gothique de la ville est achevée.</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">Les Turcs brûlent l'église et la ville en 1420. Un incendie majeur a eu lieu 1474 et les Turcs reviennent en 1532. En 1500 on vient ici de presque tous les Pays de l'Europe.</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">L'empereur Ferdinand II renouvela son serment de restaurer la foi catholique dans son empire. De nombreuses processions y ont eu lieu. Il appelait la Vierge de Mariazell \"Magna Mater\" : la Mère magnanime, ou grande dame.&#160;</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\"><span class=\"SecondIntertitre\">L'église actuelle est de style baroque </span></p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">Sous le dôme fut érigée, en 1682, une colonne votive surmontée par une statue de bois de la Vierge. Cette \"Sainte Vierge du bon retour\", a le regard aimable, la couronne en tête, le sceptre en main et elle porte l'Enfant qui bénit.</p>",

The first phrase, taken from Psalm 107:2 —Paratum cor meum Deus paratum cor meum— “My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready” is the perfect act of preparation for Holy Communion. The second phrase is Our Blessed Lady’s own acquiescence to the mystery of the Incarnation as recorded in Luke 1:30 —Fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum— “Be it done to me according to thy word”. Receiving her very own words from the lips of her servant Silvester, the Mother of God gave him Holy Communion. Claudio Ridolfi painted the episode in 1632. More on this apparition >>",

Deeply changed by this occurence, Henry left his career, social life and his wealth to walk the spiritual path and learn about the richness of inner life. In 1208 he became abbot.

St. Francis received the gift of the Sacred Stigmata in 1224 and died there in 1226. The indulgence of the Porziuncola (full remission of sin and markets receiving the sacrament of penance) illustrates the influence of this grace in this place for centuries. Orders Franciscans (as well: Poor Clares, Capuchins, minorities) have been especially dedicated to the Marian devotion evenl today. Francis was canonized in 1228. The commitment of the Franciscans through the centuries to defend the Immaculate Conception, which contributed so much to its solemn dogmatic proclamation of this mystery in 1854, is one of the most distinctive features of their way to relive the experience of the Poor Man of Assisi.

        "description": "Anthony of Padua (1195-1231) is one of the most popular saints of Christendom. Anthony reached Morocco to preach the Gospel. After some time he fell ill and, having understood this sudden illness to be a sign of the Lord, returned to Europe. On the way back, the ship that was to bring him back home went off course and ran aground near Messina. Anthony lived for a time in a Franciscan monastery from which he was to leave his true spiritual mission. One day while he was still at the convent, The Mother of God and Child Jesus appeared in all their majesty and showed him the spiritual journey ahead. Inspired by this apparition of the Virgin Mary, Anthony traveled: after having walked in the direction of Assisi in Easter of 1221 to attend the Chapter of Pentecost, on May 30, he entered the hermitage of Montepaolo (Forlì) Franciscan province of Romagna. Since then became known as a fervent preacher in northern Italy. Anthony was canonized by Pope Gregory IX in the cathedral of Spoleto May 30, 1232. In 1263, his body was taken to Padua in the new basilica. His tongue still intact evidence of the gift of the grace of preaching. San Antonio is famous for his sermons that have earned him the title of Doctor of the Church (1946).",

        "description": "Saint Peter Celestine was the eleventh of the twelve children of a poor Italian farmer. As a child, Peter had visions of our Blessed Lady, Angels and Saints. His heavenly visitors encouraged him in his prayers and chided him when he fell into any fault. His mother, though only a poor widow, sent him to school, feeling sure that he would one day be a Saint. At the age of twenty, he left his home in Apulia to live in a mountain solitude. Here he passed three years, assaulted by the evil spirits and beset with temptations of the flesh, but consoled by the visits of Angels. After this his seclusion was invaded by disciples who refused to be sent away; and the rule of life which he gave them formed the foundation of the Celestines, a branch of the Order of Saint Benedict. Angels assisted in the church which Peter built; unseen bells rang peals of surpassing sweetness, and heavenly music filled the sanctuary when he offered the Holy Sacrifice; he had consented to be ordained, to find in the Holy Eucharist assistance against temptation. Suddenly the poor anchorite found himself torn from his loved solitude, having been named by acclamation to the Papal throne, which had remained vacant for twenty-seven months. Resistance was of no avail. He took the name of Celestine, to remind him of the heaven he was leaving and for which he sighed. He was seventy-two years old. After a reign of five months, Peter judged himself unfit for the office, and summoning the cardinals to his presence, he solemnly resigned his trust. During the remaining three years of his life he worked many and great miracles. On the day after his abdication, his blessing after Mass healed a lame man. Saint Peter left the palace, desiring seclusion, but was brought back by the papal guards, for his successor feared a schism; crowds had followed Saint Peter. Lest he be prevailed upon to take back his office, he was put under surveillance at Anagni. Content, he remarked: \"I desired nothing but a cell, and a cell they have given me.\" And there he enjoyed his former loving intimacy with the Saints and Angels, and sang the Divine praises almost continually. At length, on Pentecost Sunday he told his guards he would die within the week, and immediately fell ill. He received the Last Sacraments, and the following Saturday, as he finished the concluding verse of Lauds, \"Let every spirit bless the Lord!\" he closed his eyes to this world and opened them to the vision of God.

Ma protection et mon aide ne te feront jamais défaut. »</p> </blockquote> <p>Les voyants édifient une communauté hors de la ville : c’est le début des Servites de Marie.</p> <p>Le vendredi saint 1240, la Vierge leur apparaît une seconde fois, vêtue d’un habit religieux.</p> <blockquote> <p>« Voici les vêtements avec lesquels je désire que vous soyez vêtus », leur dit-Elle.</p> </blockquote> <p>A 18 km de Florence, le mont Senario est donc le lieu où ces sept aristocrates s’engagèrent dans la vie d’ermite, avant de fonder l’ordre des servites de Marie, en développant la dévotion aux sept douleurs de Marie (qui donna lieu plus tard à une fête liturgique, le 15 septembre).</p> <p>Quand l’ordre des Servites fut fondé (en reprenant la règle des augustiniens), ils construisirent en ce lieu une chapelle et un couvent. On y vénère une Addolorata assez récente et les tombeaux des sept fondateurs.

L’année suivante, les Frères bâtissent une chapelle dédiée à la Vierge de l’Annonciation. Le sanctuaire de l’Annunziata est donc l’église des Servites de Florence, construite quand les sept fondateurs de l’ordre revinrent en ville après avoir vécu comme ermites. L’église s’est enrichi de siècle en siècle avec de nouvelles œuvres d’art. Ces œuvres témoignent de la vénération des habitants envers la très sainte Vierge Marie dans le mystère de l’Annonciation. Une fresque anonyme du XIV° a toujours été célébrée pour la douceur du visage de Marie, saisie dans l’acte de prononcer son OUI. Une tradition raconte que le peintre, ignorant et découragé devant la mission de peindre le visage de Marie, aurait été secondé par une main angélique. Les très nombreuses représentations de l’Annonciation que l’on peut admirer à Florence et en Toscane ont eu pour modèle celle-ci.</p> <p>* Le sanctuaire est gardé par les Servites de Marie<br /> * Fête : le 25 mars<br /> &#160;</p>",

        "description": "Seven men of the Florentine nobility were involved in the brotherhood of \"Laude\" to venerate the Holy Virgin Mary. On the day of the Feast of the Assumption, the Blessed Virgin appeared to them to urge them to make their lives even more holy and perfect. They decided to follow the advice of Mary and left the business world to retire to a life of prayer and penance, especially giving themselves over to the veneration of the Virgin Mary. On Good Friday, in 1239 Holy Mary appeared again and showed them a black cassock that in future they should wear, with what would motivate them to establish a new religious order. The Order would spread especially the veneration of the Sorrows that the Blessed Virgin bore with the Cross. Thus arose the Order of the Servants of Mary, Servites, or the Friars of the Hail Mary, who found rapid and wide dissemination. The seven founders of the Order of the servants were all canonized: Buonfiglio dei Monaldi (Bonfilius), Giovanni di Buonagiunta (Bonajuncta), Amadeus of the Amidei (Bartolomeus), Ricovero dei Lippi-Ugguccioni (Hugh), Benedetto dell' Antella (Manettus), Gherardino di Sostegno (Sostene), and Alessio de' Falconieri (Alexius)",

        "description": "Visonary: a prisoner History narrates that in the 13th century a condemned innocent person was saved by the Most Holy Mother in this way: the night before his execution she appeared to him in his prison cell in Rastenburg. Bringing him a piece of wood and a knife, she told him to carve an image of the Blessed Mother with Child. The man sculpted a beautiful image of the Virgin Mary with the Baby Jesus. It was so deeply moving that the jailers and the judge believed in the apparition story told by the convict and they gave him back his freedom. Thanking the Blessed mother for having saved his life, the man filled with joy went in the direction of Rossel, looking for a linden tree along the road, upon which he could place his sculpture, as the Glorious Lady had suggested to him during the vision. Precisely here, where the present day Basilica is located, the had found the magnificent linden tree, In a short time place became famous thanks to the miracles and to healings. Astonished shepherds saw their own lambs kneel down as they were passing beside the linden tree, and the blind regained their sight. It is also said that the Holy Linden upon which the statue was hung was not just an old linden tree, but that it was already venerated in a pre-Christian era. It was considered the home of Puskaite, goddess of fertility and of grain, in whose honor certain festivals were held in spring and autumn.",

The holy woman was distressed over her eternal salvation and prayed that the Most Holy Virgin to assist at the hour of death. The Blessed Virgin appeared to her and reassured her, saying: \"Yes, I will! But I wish, for your part, that you recite three Hail Marys every day, remembering the first power received by the Eternal Father, in the second the wisdom received from the Son, with the third one I love has filled the Holy Spirit \".The Blessed Virgin taught her to pray and to understand especially on how the Three Hail Marys honor the three persons of the Blessed Trinity. She became the superior of the convent school. Her contemplation and devotion was closely tied to the liturgy. Gertrude the Great noted, the last seven years of life of Matilda, the gifts of His grace interiors (Liber specialis gratiae). Matilda was always inspired not only by the veneration of Mary, but also to the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.",

Le si&egrave;ge &eacute;piscopal remonte au VI&deg; si&egrave;cle. Les documents du IXme si&egrave;cle montrent qu&rsquo;au IXme si&egrave;cle, la cath&eacute;drale et l'&eacute;glise de Notre-Dame ne sont qu'une seule et m&ecirc;me &eacute;glise. Si l&rsquo;&eacute;glise sainte Marie n&rsquo;avait pas &eacute;t&eacute; l&rsquo;&eacute;glise &eacute;piscopale depuis l'origine, l'histoire nous aurait conserv&eacute; le souvenir et la date de cette innovation. Parmi les &eacute;v&ecirc;ques de cette premi&egrave;re p&eacute;riode, il est bon de se souvenir de saint Am&eacute;d&eacute;e de Lausanne (&dagger;1159).  Une cath&eacute;drale  Fut alors entreprise la construction d&rsquo;une cath&eacute;drale gothique, consacr&eacute;e en 1275 et d&eacute;di&eacute;e &agrave; Notre-Dame. Le Pape fit sa visite le 6 octobre 1275. Et le 19 octobre l'empereur Rodolphe de Habsbourg renouvelait son serment de fid&eacute;lit&eacute; &agrave; l'Eglise.  Un po&egrave;te, le R. P. Montagneux, a rappel&eacute; ce souvenir dans son cantique &agrave; Notre-Dame de Lausanne :</p>\r\n<blockquote>Tu vis le sceptre et la tiare, Dans les beaux &acirc;ges de la foi, Te montrer au loin comme un phare  Et se prosterner devant toi. Quel jour, quand Rodolphe et Gr&eacute;goire,  Vers ton autel &eacute;tincelant, Entonn&egrave;rent un hymne &agrave; ta gloire  Aux yeux d'un peuple triomphant !</blockquote>\r\n<p>Dans cette grande ch&acirc;sse gothique qu'est la cath&eacute;drale, il y avait un &eacute;crin, c'&eacute;tait la chapelle de Notre-Dame. C'est l&agrave; que Notre-Dame de Lausanne avait sa statue. Nos a&iuml;eux l'aimaient, cette statue, ils la v&eacute;n&eacute;raient comme un enfant, quand il a du c&oelig;ur, v&eacute;n&egrave;re l'image de sa m&egrave;re. C'est l&agrave; qu'on venait surtout implorer son secours, et c'est l&agrave;, bien sp&eacute;cialement, qu'elle se plaisait &agrave; accorder ses faveurs.  La r&eacute;forme En 1533 l&rsquo;&eacute;v&ecirc;que doit c&eacute;der son si&egrave;ge aux protestants. Le culte public catholique est interrompu pendant 300 ans. La cath&eacute;drale est victime de d&eacute;pr&eacute;dations, elle est d&eacute;pouill&eacute;e, ses tr&eacute;sors sont vendus. Les catholiques sont r&eacute;duits &agrave; une vie de catacombe jusqu&rsquo;en 1835.

But with the passage of time, seeing that the city stronglyy resisted, he decided to go to the very strong castles. On August 6, 1282, the French attempted to storm the fortress of San Salvatore but the young gallant charge of the defense of the walls heroically repulsed the 'attack causing heavy losses among the French soldiers. The people of Messina knew that the enemy was stronger and better organized, and more than that in the forces of their weapons relied mostly to prayer, asking for help to the Blessed Virgin (still in the prayers of Messina often used the phrase \"OH MOTHER QUEEN OF THE LETTER MESSINA SAVE, SAVE MESSINA \"). The 'August 8 unleashed a violent storm of Messina, water and hail fell as they could, the men and women took refuge in their homes, leaving the walls of the city defenseless, the enemy took advantage of immediately approaching the hill capperina unleashing a devastating attack. The commander of troops of Messina, Alaimo Leontini, realizing the danger in time, sounded the alarm at the cost of many victims the danger was gone. But the people of Messina were now to the strong forces, given that victims were numerous and food were scarce. The French knew well and that night again went on the attack, but there were two women guards Dina and Clarenza (whose statues are reproduced in movement in the bell tower of the cathedral), and while Dina threw stones at the French military, was Clarenza in town to ring the bells as a sign of alarm. The battle was tough but the people of Messina were not alone to fight, during the fight, made an imposing appearance of the White Lady at whom the French were unable to look, was seen at key points in the battle to hang on the walls of the white veils that became resistant , and departed unseen archers arrows hitting the troops of Charles D 'Anjou, who seized with fear beat a retreat. That mysterious White Lady who threw darts and defended the walls with white veils, was none other than the Madonna, who had run to help her people. The White Lady made her second appearance on November 21, 1301, again defending the walls of Messina, and could be seen by everyone because it was broad daylight. A French soldier attemped to hurl an arrow against her but hitting the dart came back in a eye. After this new appearance, the French were frightened, took off the 'siege and left the city. The hill of capperina has always been a sacred place for the people of Messina. www.confraternitasscrocifisso.it",

His benevolent and mild reaction led to the conversion of Laziosi, who retired to pray before an image of Mary in the cathedral of Forlì to illuminate the future path of his life. Mary advised him to join the Order of the Servants. After an initial period of training at Siena, he continued his religious activities in Forli. He worked tirelessly in preaching, prayer and penance and showed unshaleable patience especially in diseases. Because he managed to miraculously heal from a tumor in his leg, he was revered as the patron protector against cancer and suffering feet. San Pellegrino Laziosi was canonized in 1726.",

In the morning, the friar thought it was all his imagination, and not believing that the mother of our Lord Jesus Christ would go to a poor friar and thought no more of it. The next night, the Virgin appeared in a dream again to Nicholas, scolding him for disobedience. The monk then asked him how he could get himself heard by the Senate. Our Lady told him not to despair, and the next day at noon, a white dove on the hill site was outlined and the area where the church was to be built. So it was, June 12, 1294, the hill was full of people and notables of Messina, and it had the appearance of a white dove marked out the air (this story is represented by statues in motion in the bell tower of the cathedral). Fra Nicholas then went to the nearby Matagrifone castle to find the Queen Constance which set forth the facts, there was present a court lady who advised the queen to drive the monk away. The evil courtesan was suddenly seized with paralysis of her arm, and excruciating pain throughout the body. The monk advised her to apologize to Madonna, she did so, and the pain went away. Queen Constance, remained shaken from the occurrence, and she promised her help, indeed it was she who laid the first stone in 1295 the church was already built.

Un jeune homme, membre de la confrérie des teinturiers en laine, fut accusé du crime, arrêté et condamné puis mort. Il nia en bloc. </p> <p>La nuit précédant l'exécution, la Vierge Marie lui apparut en songe, accompagnée de l'enfant Jésus. Marie réveilla l'accusé et lui dit en locution intérieure que son Fils avait entendu son cri d'innoncence. Une greande lumière avait envahi le cachot. Une légende locale rapporte que Jésus lui-même écrivit sur un parchemin un mot destiné au bailli de justice le prévenant de l'innoncence du voyant. </p> <p>Au matin, quelques instants avant l'exécution de la sentence, le nailli libéra le jeune homme sur le champ.</p> <p>Pour commémorer l'événement, des laïcs firent sculpter peu après une représentation de Notre-Dame de l'Encrier, placée à l'extérieur de l'église de Notre-Dame dans la ville.Cette édifice a été détruit en 1625.</p> <p>Vers 1275/80 apparaissent les prémices d'un pèlerinage ; quelques guérisons sont alléguées. En 1295, l'abbé bénédictin du monastère de Saint-Bavon de Gand, situé à proximité, demanda au pape Boniface VII d'ériger ce sanctuaire marial en collégiale. Le Souverain Pontife répondit favorablement en date du 9 juillet 1295. Le 13 mars 1296, le chapitre des chanoines fut élevé \"<em>à la gloire de Dieu et de la Très Glorieuse Vierge et Mère de Dieu, sachant que Dieu a rendu célèbre cette église par de nombreux prodiges.</em>\" La même année Edouard I<sup>er</sup>, roi d'Angleterre, se rend en personne à Aardenburg. En 1300, une incontestable dévotion à Notre-Dame de l'Encrier est désormais implantée dans toute la région. Cette année-là, Philippe le Bel y fait un pèlerinage. D'autres princes suivront : Edouard III d'Angleterre (24 juin 1340), Charles le Téméraire (23 avril 1466), Edouard IV (27 décembre 1470), etc.</p> <p>Chaque année, la statue réputée miraculeuse est portée en procession. Les chanoines de Bruges et ceux de Saint-Sauveur se rendent une fois l'an en procession au sanctuaire de Notre-Dame de l'Encrier. La guide des gantiers de Bruges offre un manteau de velours à Marie à chaque anniversaire des faits. </p> <p>A partir de 1580, Aardenburg passe aux protestants. Le pèlerinage décline et le sanctuaire est démoli en 1625. La statue d'origine est amenée à Bruges puis placée à l'intérieur de la façade de l'hôtel de ville jusqu'au 30 décembre 1792, jour où elle jetée à terre et brisée. Des morceaux épars sont recueillis à la hâte : ils vont permettre de réaliser des copies de l'ancienne oeuvre au cours du XIX<sup>e</sup> siècle. </p> <p>En 1804, le clergé créé une paroisse catholique puis, en 1850, une église dédiée à Notre-Dame de l'Assomption sort de terre. En 1904, à l'occasion du centenaire de la nouvelle paroisse, l'évêque fait imprimer une prière à la Vierge d'Aardenburg : \"<em>Vous vous êtes montrée une puissance protectrice vis-à-vis de ceux qui vous ont invoquée avec confiance ; vous avez été le refuge et le secours de ceux qui, en ce lieu, sont venus vous honorer. Aussi, aidez-moi en tous les dangers du corps et de l'âme...</em>\"</p> <p>En 1853, le premier magistrat de Bruges fait sculpter une nouvelle statue de Notre-Dame de l'Encrier, en pierre blanche. Le 31 août 1853, à l'occasion de la visite de léopold Ier, roi des Belges, l'évêque bénit cette réalisation. Le 9 septembre suivant, une copie est placée dans la cathédrale.</p>",

        "description": "The Sanctuary of the Madonna of Rescue stands isolated on the high plain between Monte Ercole and the town of Sant'Agata in central Italy, about 25 miles from the Adriatic Sea. Local tradition holds that an earlier chapel there marked the place where the Virgin helped defeat an invading army. Perhaps the simple Romanesque style of the present church, built around 1520, reflects that of the former chapel. At that time, devotion to the Madonna del Soccorso had spread from Sicily throughout Italy. The Sanctuary's altarpiece depicts a story that took place in Palermo in 1306, although local tradition has moved the apparition to a site near this chapel. A young mother, impatient with her child, cries, \"To the devil with you!\" A demon appears and threatens the boy, but a radiant woman saves him. The mother and child give thanks in church, where they recognize the radiant woman in a fresco of the Madonna. The original painting was stolen in the 1970s; the present image is a copy commissioned from local artist Alpico Prosperi. Another miracle story, unique to Sant'Agata, involved a woman who invoked the Madonna del Soccorso when her jealous lover shot her in the breast. The unharmed woman's velvet corset with the bullet hole is on display in the chapel. The shrine became a regional place of pilgrimage, especially by fishermen thankful for Our Lady's help at sea. Her annual festa on the Sunday before Assumption Day now includes a Blessing of Automobiles.

        "description": "Mary appeared to St. Bridget of Sweden , when she was only six years and accompanied her the rest of her life with many apparitions and revelations. The saint in 1316 married the noble lawyer Ulf Guidmarsson and had eight children with him, including the future St. Catherine of Sweden. For her religious devotion and her charity, Bridget soon became highly esteemed. After a journey of pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela (Spain), her husband retired to a Cistercian monastery and died there a year later (1344). This meant a turning point in the life of Bridget: She settled in and received revelations from Jesus Christ and the Holy Virgin Mary there. During this period of contemplation, Bridget became a mystical bride of Christ. Through a revelation, she was ordered to found a new religious order. In fact in 1346, through the work of Bridget, the monastery of the Brigidine Order. After a period of strict penance and prayer, she went to Rome in 1349 to obtain the approval of the Order religious and attend the jubilee proclaimed in 1350. She stayed for the remaining twenty-three years of her life in Italy. In 1370, the pope gave Bridget ot approval to establish the monastic order of the Holy.Savior, which later became (1379) the Order of Saint Bridget (Brigidine), with monks and nuns. In 1372/73, she undertook a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The saint is considered among the greatest and the most mystical of medieval women, and was canonized by Pope Boniface IX in 1391. Among the many writings that Bridget has left us, her greatest is a praise of the virtue and the life of the Virgin Mary.",

        "description": "Born in Florence, 1200; died 17 February, 1310, at Mount Senario, near Florence. He was the son of Bernard Falconieri, a merchant prince of Florence, and one of the leaders of the Republic. His family belonged to the Guelph party, and opposed the Imperialists whenever they could consistently with their political principles. Alexis grew up in the practice of the most profound humility. He joined the Laudesi, a pious confraternity of the Blessed Virgin, and there met the six future companions of his life of sanctity. He was favoured with an apparition of the Mother of God, 15 August, 1233, as were these companions. The seven soon afterwards founded the Order of the Servites. With consistent loyalty and heroism Alexis at one abandoned all, and retired to La Camarzia, a house on the outskirts of the town, and the following year to Mt. Senario. With characteristic humility, he traversed, as a mendicant, in quest of alms for his brethren, the streets of the city through which he had lately moved as a prominent citizen. So deep and sincere was him humility that, though he lived to the great age of hundred and ten years, he always refused to enter the priesthood, of which he deemed himself unworthy. The duties of our Saint were confined principally to the material needs of the various communities in which he lived. In 1252 the new church at Cafaggio, on the outskirts of Florence, was completed under his care, with the financial assistance of Chiarissimo Falconieri. The miraculous image of the Annunciation, still highly venerated in Italy, had its origin here. St. Juliana Falconieri, his niece, was trained in sanctity under his personal direction. The influence exerted on his countrymen by Alexis and his companions may be gathered from the fact that in a few years ten thousand persons had enrolled themselves under the banner of the Blessed Virgin in the Servite Order. At his death he was visited by the Infant Jesus in visible form, as was attested by eye-witnesses. His body rests near the church of the Annunciation, in Florence. Clement XI declared Alexis worthy of the veneration of the faithful, 1 December, 1717, and accorded the same honour to his six companions, 3 July 1725.",

At a time when scholars believed that no colloquial tongue could ever replace Latin as a gentleman's language, Jordan worked to make Italian the beautiful tongue that it is today. That's not the reason he was beatified by the Church but it's interesting and sometimes overlooked. Jordan attended the University of Paris where he first encountered the Dominican friars in 1276. Four years later, probably after obtaining his degrees, he returned to Italy and took the habit. He began a long teaching career there as soon as he was qualified to do so. Because of the excellence of his preaching in Florence, Jordan was appointed first lector there in 1305. He seems to have been fascinated with the whole question of preaching as an apostolic tool, and to have been one of the first to make a scientific study of it. He pointed out that the Greek church was \"invaded by a multitude of errors,\" because the Greeks had no preachers; he could never say enough in praise of Saint Dominic's farsightedness in establishing an order specifically for preaching. Jordan studied methods of making sermons more effective, both by using examples that would reach the people, and by the use of the vernacular. This latter was a much-disputed subject in his day (they had Dan Amon's then, too); Jordan was considered a daring innovator. Because it was controversial, he strove to make Italian a beautiful instrument on which he could play the melodies of the Lord. Blessed with an extraordinary memory, Jordan is supposed to have known the breviary by heart, as well as the missal, most of the Bible (with its marginal commentary), plus the second part of the Summa. This faculty of memory he used in his sermons, but he was quick to point out to young preachers that learning alone can never make a preacher. By the holiness of his own life he made this plain, and continually preached it to those he was training to preach. Jordan of Pisa had two great devotions--to Our Blessed Mother and to Saint Dominic. Once he was favored with a vision of Our Lady; she came into the fathers' refectory and served at table. Jordan, who was the only one who could see her, could barely eat for excitement. He spoke often of her in his sermons, and also of Saint Dominic. He founded a number of confraternities in Pisa, one of which has lasted until now. Jordan died on his way to Paris to teach at Saint Jacques. His body was returned from Piacenza, where death overtook him, to rest in the church at Pisa (Benedictines, Dorcy).",

He lived his \"conversion\", as inner experience of grace, was to become the servant of Eternal Wisdom. In fact, after he wrote The Little Book of Eternal Wisdom, which recounts a dialogue meeting between the servant (the author himself) and the Eternal Wisdom, identified as Jesus Christ and other times as the Madonna. The life of Henry Suso was strongly marked by intense mystical experiences, studied from 1322 to 1326 in Cologne, and became a staunch supporter of the ideas of Master Eckhart although later criticized by his Order. Suso had a friendly relationship with John Tauler, Henry Nordlingen and the Friends of God . Since 1348 the mystic lived in Ulm Germany. The Little Book of Eternal Wisdom contains most of his many mystical experiences, such as description of many revelations and apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary. These were collected and edited by a nun Elisabeth Stagel. He died at Ulm, January 25, 1366; declared Blessed in 1831 by Gregory XVI, who assigned his feast in the Dominican Order to March 2.

While Andrew had been celebrating the midnight Mass of Christmas, the Blessed Virgin appeared to him and told him he would leave this world on the feast of the Epiphany, to meet God. It came to pass, and he died on that day. Miracles were so multiplied at his death that Pope Eugene IV permitted a public cult immediately; but it was only in 1629 that Pope Urban VIII canonized him.

Egidia Mathis (that was the lady's name), seeing that she was going to be attacked by men who intended to rape her despite her condition, clung on desperately to the image of the Madonna painted on the column, calling for her help. Without warning, a beam of light flashed from the image, blinding the two mercenaries who fled in a panic. Then, the Madonna herself appeared to Egidia comforted her for several minutes and assured her that the danger over. Then Our Lady vanished. Due to such feelings of fear and emotion, Egidia gave birth at the foot of the column. With her new-born child wrapped in her shawl, the young mother managed to reach the nearest house. The news of the awful incident spread like wildfire all around town: although it was late, crowds flocked to the place where the attempted attack and the apparition of the Virgin had taken place. There, an extraordinary sight greeted them: the column was surrounded with thick blackthorn bushes which were unexpectedly covered in white flowers despite the harsh late December weather. Since this time, the bushes flower yearly over the same period of days.",

Because of his physical condition, he wavered but was told not to worry. He struggled to fulfill his mission, and when he reached the top he stopped to gather his strength. It was at that point that he felt a strange tingling in his leg. He rose as a new person and ran to tell his parents carrying the crutch he no longer needed. There are many wondrous stories of Our Lady of Montenero and many miraculous events attributed to her. Tradition also says that it was through her intercession that the city was saved from the devastation of an earthquake on January 27, 1472. Then there was the miraculous wind that saved the city from invasion launched by Emperor Maximilian I in 1496 and her deliverance of the city from a plague in 1720. In thanksgiving for the latter, all the Leghorn Bills of Health down through the year 1859 bore the image of the Madonna of Montenero. She is also credited with saving St. Paul of the Cross, founder of the Passionists, whose ship was floundering off the coast as he made his way to Pisa in 1750. The shrine of Our Lady atop the mountain looking down on Leghorn is a very popular pilgrimage destination. Especially attracted to the shine are young, unmarried women who, on the eves of Marian feast days, cast garlands of flowers before her solitarily unique and engrossing image. The painting depicts the Blessed Mother seated with the Jesus on her left knee. A small bird rests on her right forearm singing. (Also see the title Virgin with Garland.)",

        "description": "Ludwig I, King of Hungary (1342-1382), was a fervent devotee of Mary. In 1363, the Kingdom of Hungary was seriously threatened by an army of two hundred thousand Tatars. Louis, feeling lost in front of the imminent danger, turned to a portrait of the Madonna and prayed constantly to help his kingdom, then suddenly fell into a deep sleep where he dreamed that Mary took the portrait from the table and placed it on his chest. Upon awakening, Louis, finding himself with the image of Mary on his chest, realized that the dream was to reality. Also in this dream, the Blessed Virgin had made a recommendation to erect a chapel in her devotion in Styria (Austria). Inspired by this vision, King Louis fought strongly and fearlessly against the mighty Tartar army. It reported a wonderful and incredible victory, then attributed the miraculous intervention of Madonna. In gratitude for the narrow escape, Louis went on pilgrimage among Styrian mountains to fulfill a vow. Next to an old church, where a statue of Mary was venerated, he built an exquisite chapel to Mary. The church was built in ancient Roman style in 1200 by King Henry Vladislav of Moravia in gratitude for healing from a serious illness; it was placed inside the Our Lady of linden wood carved by Magnus Monaco. From building the chapel, gift of King Louis, \"Mary Help of Christians (Mariazell Styria) before invoked as \"Mother of the Slav peoples,\" was considered by Hungarian as their sanctuary and became a national goal of imposing pilgrimages. To commemorate this most memorable victory, King Louis erected right on the spot where the Mother of God appeared to him in Slovakia the church of \"Mary Help of Christians.\" This church contains a copy of the statue of Mariazell.

It was a woman who offered to help her and when Catarina later went to the top of the mountain as instructed and dug a hole, a spring of crystal-clear water was found. \"Now go and tell the people of your village that here they will find a remedy for all their infirmities,\" said the woman, who was apparently the Virgin Mary. The vision was accepted by the local bishop. D. Pedro de Castillo, when a blind man washed his eyes in the water and regained his vision. In the same vicinity around the same time, another marvel was recorded as a knight named Nuno was headed for Aljubarrota. He spotted a small church dedicated to Mary in what is today the county of Ourem. Getting off his horse, Nuno entered the church and knelt before the altar, invoking Mary before heading into a great battle between Portugal and the Castillian army, which outnumbered his force. After the prayers the knight marched to battle and while passing through the village of Fatima felt a heavenly presence. The horses suddenly lowered themselves as if to kneel and a number of knights claimed to see angels, including the Archangel Michael. Invoking him, they then went on their mission and claimed victory on August 15, feast of Mary's Assumption.",

When the mother woke up, she did not see her son and, realizing what had happened, he hastened to the valley and found the child unharmed. He told her that he had fallen and been caught by a wonderful lady. The child's father was sure that it was the Madonna to save her son. In gratitude for saving him, he had a chapel built in honor of Our Lady in the cave, where his wife was sleeping. It soon became a place of pilgrimage. The first chapel was destroyed by a fire in 1466 but four years later had already been rebuilt. In 1530, in the full swing of the Reformation, the second chapel was plundered and destroyed. The Swabian Jakob Augsburger rebuilt it. The image of the Virgin is venerated in a chapel in the cave under the current Benedictine monastery. To get there one must go down 59 steps. Numerous votives testify along the way to the cave the gratitude of pilgrims and devotees who down the centuries have been here for Mother of God.",

        "description": "Feast Day: February 2 According to tradition, the Virgin appeared in 1392 to two aboriginal Guanches who shepherded his flock, who, on reaching the mouth of a gully, they noticed that the cattle did not advance, as if something from going through. To see what was the matter, one of the pastors came forward and saw a rock atop a wooden image about a meter high of a woman. Porta a candle in his left hand and carrying a child on his right arm. The boy had in his hands a golden bird. The history of this title is linked intimately to the history of the Canary Islands , especially the island of its appearance, Tenerife . No agreement on the year of the appearance, but the majority opinion is that it appeared in the mouth of the ravine Chimisay, municipality canary of Guimaras , 95 years before the conquest of Tenerife , ie appear from 1392 to 1401 . It is therefore the first Marian apparition in the Canaries. Fray Alonso de Espinosa described the history in 1594 . According to the legend told by Fray Alonso de Espinosa, were two pastors Guanches to enclose their cattle to the caves when they noticed that the cattle were swirling and would not go. Seeking the cause looked toward the mouth of the Barranco de Chimisay and saw on a rock, almost to the sea, the figure of a woman who believed animated. As men were forbidden to speak or approach women in the wilderness, they made signs to withdraw in order to pass the cattle. But want to execute the action, the arm is stiff and motionless stood. The other pastor wanted to hurt her with his knife. But instead of hurting her, was wounded the same. Frightened, the two pastors fled Chinguaro , cave-palace mencey Acaymo to refer what happened. The mencey came with their counselors. She did not answer but no one dared to touch her. The mencey decided that these two pastors were injured and those who collect for transport to the palace. They, in contact with the image, they were healed. The mencey realized that this woman with a child in her arms was something supernatural. The same king then wanted to take it in his arms, but after a stretch, by weight, needed to call for help. Thus, in place of the apparition's now a cross and where the relief requested mencey, a shrine to Nuestra. Señora del Socorro. Staging of the apparition of the Virgin in El Socorro beach, Guimaras. She was taken to a cave near the king's palace now converted into a chapel . Later a young man named Anton, who had been taken into slavery by the Spaniards and had managed to escape and return to their island, recognized in the miraculous image of the Virgin Mary . He, having been baptized he told the court mencey faith and his Christian that he was holding. Just came to know Mary as \"Mother of the Sustainer of heaven and earth\" ( Guanche : Achoron Guayaxerax Axmayex Achaman or Chaxiraxi ) and transferred to the Cave of Achbinico (behind the present Basilica of Candelaria ) for public veneration.",

The shepherd girl noticed that her tongue had become loose and she answered that she would ask her father's permission. And she did so. When she found him, he was surprised to see his daughter speaking. He believed in the veracity of the apparition and told his daughter that he would give not only the sheep but anything that Lady asked for. Happy as a lark the shepherd girl ran to the place where she had seen the Lady, who asked her to build a chapel in her honor. But like the story of the Virgin of the Ferns the story does not end here. When the father arrived at the place he found a simple image of the Virgin among the poison ivy. \"It was here that the Mother of God wanted her chapel built\". But the good father that that place was not a good one for the building of a chapel. \"Our Lady certainly would not mind if the place was on a hill or in a sheltered valley: it would be even better for her and for the faithful. So much wind up there...\" So he picked up the image and went home. He called his carpenter friends and chose a good place at Casal de Santa Maria. And he left the image in a temporary niche. But, on the following day the image was gone. \"Who had been the rascal\"? They looked everywhere and found that the image had returned to its place, wild and windy, in the middle of the poison ivy.",

According to Marian tradition preserved in Ethiopia, following the Christ Child's explicit prayer, formulated during the flight of the Holy Family to Egypt, the Virgin appeared annually to faithful pilgrims, who ardently desired to see her from the bottom of their hearts, at Al-Maghti at the time of the pilgrimage which took place during the Coptic month of Bachnas (at the end of May), with the archangels Michael and Gabriel, as well as holy martyrs.

Found a spring and in that place occurred many miracles and healings. The plague ceased, and the Bishop recognized the apparitions as authentic. After a century, the source was exhausted, but in 1955, during excavations for the new convent, found the spring of water. The Virgin appeared again to Vincenza Parisi, on August 1, 1428. The city was in dire straits, and the Virgin repeated her request and her promises to the old woman. Vicenza went back down to the city and she was believed this time: the city officials, the Council of One Hundred and the Council of Five Hundred gathered in the Great Hall of Reason, and decided to build the church on Monte Berico in as short a time as possible. So the people started building twenty-four days later. The Virgin had told Vincenza about a water source that would flow out of a rock in the place where the shrine would be built, and this is exactly what happened. During the construction work, \"a marvellous and incredible source of water flowed... to the point of flooding the area like an abundant river coming noisily down the mount.\" Also, in reference to the Virgin's second promise, great quantities of money were received. \"Construction was begun on August 25, the great plague partly disappeared, and the church was completed in three months. After that the region was completely freed from this great calamity, so much so that ever since that day, through God's protection, it has never again suffered from that disease. \" The busy shrine of Our Lady of Berico has now become one of largest shrines dedicated to Mary in Europe. \"On the first Sunday of the month we have an average of twenty-two thousand confessions.

Tous les deux furent retrouvés intacts. L’événement fut interprété comme un message surnaturel : on creusa à la base de la colonne et on trouva une statue de la Vierge à l’enfant, que l’on plaça dans l’église S.

C&rsquo;est une Vierge &agrave; l&rsquo;Enfant dont le rude visage s&rsquo;&eacute;claire pourtant d&rsquo;un sourire. Jadis la cavit&eacute; rocheuse s&rsquo;ouvrait sur la vall&eacute;e.

Son origine remonte plus haut, n&eacute;anmoins, probablement au milieu du XIVe si&egrave;cle. Un miracle lui donna naissance, celui de la pr&eacute;servation d&rsquo;un enfant tomb&eacute; du haut des rochers dans le pr&eacute;cipice. En reconnaissance &agrave; la Vierge qui avait sauv&eacute; le bambin, une statue, de bois sans doute, fut plac&eacute;e dans la caverne. Et si nombreux furent les fid&egrave;les qui vinrent y prier que, pour subvenir &agrave; leurs besoins spirituels, l&rsquo;&eacute;v&ecirc;que de B&acirc;le dut nommer un chapelain.

Tant d&rsquo;&acirc;mes ont aupr&egrave;s d&rsquo;elle, en effet, trouv&eacute; le r&eacute;confort et la paix du c&oelig;ur.  Comment pourrait-il en &ecirc;tre autrement ? Nous lisons dans les psaumes que Dieu fendit la pierre et fit sortir des ruisseaux de la roche (Ps. 77, 15-16) et encore qu&rsquo;&agrave; Isra&euml;l le Seigneur donna &laquo;le miel du rocher et l&rsquo;huile de la pierre&raquo; (cf Ps. 80,17 et Deut.,32, 13). Par le Christ qu&rsquo;elle a mis au monde, Marie n&rsquo;a-t-elle pas donn&eacute; &agrave; nos &acirc;mes &agrave; la fois l&rsquo;eau qui lave et d&eacute;salt&egrave;re, l&rsquo;huile qui panse nos blessures et le miel de toute saveur ? [&hellip;] C&rsquo;est pourquoi reprenant encore une parole du psalmiste, les p&egrave;lerins de Notre Dame de la Pierre, peuvent-ils lui dire, reconnaissants : &laquo; Quand en mon sein abondent les soucis, tes consolations r&eacute;jouissent mon &acirc;me &raquo; (Ps. 93,19).</p>\r\n<p class=\"petitAdroite\">Jean Ladame, Notre Dame de toute l&rsquo;Europe, R&eacute;siac, Montsur, 1984, p. 153-159.</p>\r\n<p class=\"IntertitreDeArticle\">Le monast&egrave;re b&eacute;n&eacute;dictin de Mariastein</p>\r\n<p>En 1638 les moines de l'abbaye de Beinwil &eacute;migr&egrave;rent au Mariastein pour assurer le service religieux, ils construisirent le monast&egrave;re peu &agrave; peu, et ils consacr&egrave;rent la grande &eacute;glise abbatiale aux trois nefs et aux cinq arcades en 1655.

Ces apparitions tirent leur origine d'une tradition des chrétiens éthiopiens selon laquelle, pendant la fuite en Egypte, l'Enfant Jésus aurait demandé à Marie de se manifester chaque année, accompagnée des archanges Michel et Gabriel, à tous les pèlerins sincères et pieux.</p> <p>Le pèlerinage proprement dit aurait été fondé à la suite d'une vision que les moines auraient eu dès le commencement de leur communauté : une \"colonne de lumière\" effleura l'autel, puis se transforma en une \"barque de lumière\" transportant la Vierge et des saints. L'apparition demanda aux religieux d'associer dorénavant les fidèles à ce miracle.</p> <p>Selon des témoignages divers, les fidèles lançaient vers l'apparition des foulards afin qu'elle les touche. On dit que certains pouvaient observer à certains moments proches et amis défunts réunis autour de la Vierge.</p> <p>Ces apparitions sont mentionnées dans le synaxaire liturgique éthiopien (livre de la vie des saints pour chaque jour), à la date du 29 mai.</p>",

Often Francesca Romana received mystical apparitions of his guardian angel, the Saints and the Madonna, to whom Francesca was most devoted (she dictated her mystical experiences of ninety-seven Marian visions to her confessor). During the struggle for the papacy in Rome, her husband was almost murdered. In 1425 she laid the foundations for a religious foundation (Society of Oblates of the Monastery of Santa Maria la Nova Olivetan) that in 1433 was officially approved (today: Oblates of Santa Francesca Romana). Despite papal approval, Francis remained in family life, but when her husband died in 1436, she assumed leadership of the congregation. The mystic died March 9, 1440 reciting Vespers of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a practice she followed since childhood. In 1608 she was canonized.",

On March 9, Mary took a cross from Inés and planted it to mark the location of her desired shrine, which later became a Franciscan convent. For many years this anniversary was celebrated with a procession from the town to the rural sanctuary, where the nuns would expose the cross. During the Civil War, eight sisters were martyred and the shrine burned. In 1988, rebuilding began. On March 5, 1994, the new church was dedicated and the Bishop of Getafe designated it a Diocesan Sanctuary. The new convent is home to Clarissan nuns, and in recent years, the March 9 pilgrimage has been revived. - In 1449, a young girl saw the Virgin for eight days in a row. the apparition requested that a church be built. - A famous incident occurred in southwest of Madrid when a twelve-year-old girl named Inés Martinez had a total of six apparitions: Mary dressed in a snow-white abrochada and wearing gold slippers. Here she warned people to confess their sins because an epidemic was coming.",

Mary sought shelter under a small kiosk where there was a fresco of the Blessed Virgin Mary, painted by Augustine of Pavia as a votive offering for being saved from drowning in the river Ticino. The river then ran a few yards away from where the girl was, a place studded with bushes of hawthorn. Suddenly a ball of light appeared. The Blessed Virgin Mary entrusts the girl with a mission: \" Here at Garlasco I want a sanctuary to protect the whole Lomellina. Many are the graces that I pour into this place and my children will experience the treasures of my mercy.\" Maria returned to Garlasco and neighbors heard the child's mouth, no longer deaf and dumb, at once believed the Our Lady's message of the apparition. From that moment the girl called Maria was blessed by Mary with the miracle that Our Lady had made on her. The pastor of Garlasco took care of her, who retired to the convent, run by nuns and located on the western boundary of the territory of Garlasco Tromello between Alagna and near the river Terdoppio. The miraculous event gave way the building of the sanctuary. The building was erected in its present form, in four building campaigns that winds through the centuries. The first chapel dates back to the two decades between 1462 and 1483 and its alloy construction to the wonder above narrated.",

Often Mary appeared to him to exhort us to pray and preach the Rosary. He led the Brotherhood of palm kernel and led a life devoted. He died on the anniversary of the birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1475 in Zwolle. Alan de Rupe wrote the Psalms of Mary (or The Rosary also) that belonged to the prayer of obligation Marian-inspired religious communities. The Psalms included 15 Our Fathers, 150 Hail Marys and 150 contemplations. One day, in a Dominican church in Paris, during the All Saints' Day octave, Bl. Alain de la Roche reproached himself for the lukewarm way he was reciting his rosary. Suddenly, Our Lady, accompanied by other virgins appeared before him and said, \"Do not flee, my son! If you don't believe who my companions and I are, just make the sign of the cross before us. If we are hellish visions, we will disappear immediately. If, on the contrary, we are heavenly visions, we will remain, and the light that emanates from each one of us will brighten.\" Alain made the sign of the cross and the light of the apparition grew brighter. \"O my son, doubt no more! I am your virginal bride,\" Our Lady told him. \"I have always loved you and I am concerned about you always. But you must know that nobody is without pain in this world; neither me, nor my Son, nor any of these saints have lived without suffering. What is more, you must keep the faith and patience as your weapons and prepare yourself for trials more difficult than those which you have experienced up to now. I have chosen you to fight like a brave man and a hero under the flag of Jesus Christ, not like a parody of a soldier! You will stand next to me under my banner. As for the moments of spiritual desert that you have experienced these past few days, don't let them worry you anymore. I wanted you to take that test. Accept it now as a penance and punishment for your past sins. Accept it also as a means of making progress in patience and for the salvations of others, both dead and alive.\" This is how Blessed Alain de la Roche described the apparition that sent him out into the world to preach: Her beauty seemed to reach the summits of what is possible; and, before such beauty, the beauty of flowers, even the beauty of the stars are only a pale copy, a formless shadow, a coarse outline. There exuded from the depths of her physical presence a sweet, powerful and intoxicating perfume. The accent of her voice and her words were so charming-nothing in this world can come close to comparing to her beauty.\"",

Elle est conservée dans la chapelle bâtie en 1469 au sommet d’un rocher, sur l’île de la Loire portant le même nom, selon un plan original en deux nefs, avec un autel en granit. C’est un sanctuaire vivant qui a bénéficié de la popularité de saint Maurille, disciple de saint Martin de Tours, évêque d’Angers à la fin du IVe siècle : cet ami de Dieu y chassa victorieusement le diable. </p> <p>Au XIe siècle, Buhardus, chevalier breton, en devint propriétaire grâce à une donation du comte d’Anjou, Geoffroi Martel. A la mort du chevalier, l’île revînt à l’abbaye Saint-Nicolas d’Angers. Au XVe siècle, René d’Anjou (+ 1480) et Louis XI embellirent l’endroit. Ce dernier souverain, célèbre pour sa piété mariale, prononça un vœu à Notre-Dame de Béhuard et offrit une ‘cloche de paix’, cœur d’un superbe chêne taillé d’un seul tenant, installé à l’intérieur de la chapelle. En 1481, un chapitre de chanoines prit possession des lieux. La statue a été couronnée le 24 septembre 1923. Le cardinal Roncalli, futur Jean XXIII, s’y recueillit en 1946.

Curious tries in vain to climb up the steep rock, but can not. The next day returns with a long ladder and a good ax to clean the brambles and bushes, and introduces the hole mate Dattilo with a lantern that can see a beautiful and spacious cave. The next night, however, while sleeping, Gabriel sees in a dream the Virgin Mary, who tells him: \"Gabriel, leaving to others the care of the goats; edificami a chapel in the cave, and I'll always be your advocate.\" The next morning Gabriel was perplexed about what to do, it is a simple dream, but decided to personally inspect the cave. This is convenient, even if wet, to build a chapel. Do not spend many days, while grazing his flock and he is intent to weave wicker, sees a mysterious light in the cave and at the same time feels the same words that Our Lady had told him in a dream. Stunned by this clear and categorical command, decides to leave the herd, wearing a coarse habit, and start a new life, calling themselves Fra 'Gabriel. Then obtained the permission of the Abbot of the Benedictine Santa Maria de Olearia in Maiori, under whose spiritual jurisdiction is the territory, he builds an altar in the cave of the miracle dedicating it to the Blessed Virgin under the title of \"advocate.\" The news of the miraculous event spreads like wildfire and soon, with the help of the people, is built at the top of the rock church with a bell tower and a few rooms for the convenience of pilgrims. These rooms were enlarged in 1508 and increased by the same Fra 'Gabriel, to satisfy the desire of seven of his fellow countrymen who want to give themselves to him as a hermit's life. This is the first group of many hermits who honor the Virgin until 1687, that is, until the coming of the Camaldolese of Monte Corona, who built a hermitage regular. The Camaldolese decorate the church with marble and precious furnishings, September 8, 1720 the church was consecrated and dedicated to SS. dell'Avvocata by the Bishop of Ravello and Scala, Bishop Warrior. In memory of the work of expansion and embellishment made by the Fathers Camaldolesi is placed on the center door a plaque that still today can be read in Latin. It recalls the discovery of the cave by means of a dove, and the construction of the primitive church in honor of B. Virgin Advocate, by Gabriel Cinnamo in 1475, enlarged and embellished by the children of St. Romuald in 1719.",

Rapp, in D. Dinet, 22 and Giard, 69). Jeanne, daughter of Louis XI and Charlotte of Savoy, married Louis of Orleans (future Louis XII) who ended their marriage in 1498, year in which the blessed Gabriel-Maria, Cordelier, became her spiritual director. According to hagiographic tradition, the Virgin encourages her to found the order of the Annonciades, approved by a canonical bull instituted by Pope Alexander VI on February 12, 1502. Messages * evoke the Franciscan and Marian dimension of the Annonciade: \"By the wounds of my Son, you will have the Mother\" (Chronicle of the Annunciation, 77; Drèze, 159, 162, 275, n ° 187 and H. Jacobs, \"The spiritual intuition of Jeanne de Valois\", in D. Dinet, 85). Historians of spirituality have retained his devotion to the hearts of Jesus and Mary. The hagiographic tradition of the classical age relates the following facts: \"Jesus Christ and the Virgin presented her with two hearts on a platter, Jesus Christ smilingly telling her also put hers there. But the Blessed One was greatly astonished that, having sought it, she perceived that she had none, because it was more perfectly united to that of Jesus than to her own body. \"(Chronicle of the Annonciade, 183-184, quoted by S.

The white lady also carried another message that affected the nearby people and those of all the surrounding valleys. She asked the two children, to make known her desire to be venerated in that place and promises her protection. Returning home, Donato and Cornelia tell all about appearance and the words they heard. After an initial hesitation, the population believed the simple and naive story of the two children.

The legend reads: \"On August 15, circa 1484, as they strolled along the banks Friars of The Lump, a boat manned by three sailors stood by the friars. They got off the boat along with a wooden box and begged the friars to be kept in the convent until the time they could come back for her. They accepted this task, and for some years was kept under the protection of the monastery, until one day a monk of the Third Order of St. Francis asked to open the box in the presence of all the brothers. After being favorably resolved your request, opened the box and showed the Sacred Image, and at that moment all exclaimed at once: Oh, Bella!'s Like heaven! After this event, they decided to place it on the altar of his church. When the news spread throughout the region, the faithful flocked to stare at the image and, in turn, gave alms for the construction of the convent, which at the time the works were paralyzed. Since that event he was enshrined Nstra title. Ms. de la Bella ... » The image remained in the convent until 1835, when it was moved to the Church of Santo Domingo de Guzman in Lepe. The Chronicles tells us so: \"In the year 1835, Mendizabal decreed by Royal Order of the Ministry of Grace and Justice of July 25, the secularization of some convents. Entering them the Convent of Our Lady of Beauty, superiors decided to move to the nearby Monastery of La Rabida taking with them their belongings image. On August 7 came a boat on the shores of El Terron for such rushed. Upon learning this fact Brother Joseph, chaplain of the convent and well known in Lepe for this, decided to warn the residents of this town in middle of the night, calling door to door to tell them what was going to happen. They all excited, followed the monk to the monastery. the monk opened the door of the chapel and shouted Viva la Virgen de la Bella!. The people who were, took the picture with her hands and took her running and almost in a twinkling, fearing that followed. Arriving at dawn to the Cross First, where were calmer. Finally, they took her to the church, entering triumphantly. \" Since that time the image remains on the town.",

She could not gather them together and crying, she exclaimed: \"God help me, help me with your light, Virgin Mary\", when it was dark. In the act he heard angel songs and saw the Virgin arrive with the Child in his arms and ordered her to go down to Aniezo and tell the priest to go up and send the brush that covered the entrance of a cave to clean, where he would find an image the one that should dedicate a sanctuary, to receive the people special graces. She abandoned the sheep and went down to the village. They say that the devil presented her in a pilgrim's outfit and tried to hinder her, but she entrusted herself to the Virgin and the enemy disappeared. Upon reaching the town, the priest did not believe her, and the girl returned. The Virgin imposed the sign of the cross to chase away the demon and sent it back to Aniezo. The priest, seeing her, went up with several neighbors at dawn and found the cave. They took her to the parish and the construction of the hermitage began, where the shepherdess remained as caretaker or blessed of the sanctuary. The image was canonically crowned by the Bishop of Santander on May 2, 1991. Pop John XXIII named her patron saint of Liébana in 1960. It has great devotion not only in Liébana but also in Polaciones, Nansa Valley. They also celebrate this dedication in Pesaguero on September 8, in Pejanda (Polaciones).

C&rsquo;est l&rsquo;&eacute;difice projet&eacute; par Galeazzo Maria Sforza, commenc&eacute; en 1493 et agrandi au fur et &agrave; mesure que les p&egrave;lerins augmentaient. En 1513 fut aussi construit le magnifique portique, ample et accueillant, qui semble fait pour accompagner les p&egrave;lerins jusqu&rsquo;au lieu m&ecirc;me du miracle.

Elle aurait été vénérée dans la basilique Sainte-Sophie de Constantinople.</p> <p>Cette image passa d'Orient en Occident en 1453 lorsque des fidèles orthodoxes grecs l'amenèrent à Rome, lors de la conquête de Constantinople par Mahomet II ; elle fut alors confiée à l'entourage du cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville, le prélat qui fit reconstruire l'église de Saint-Augustin à ses frais.</p> <p>En 1485, le pape Innocent VIII organisa des processions dans tous les quartiers de Rome pendant une grave épidémie. Il plaça l'icône en tête de ces manifestations et une multitude de guérisons fut alléguée. Le 26 août 1500, elle fut portée solennellement à la basilique Saint-Pierre puis reconduite dans son église d'origine. Son couronnement date du 4 mars 1641.</p> <p>D'autres images sont conservées dans l'église Saint-Augustin : la Vierge de l'Enfantement (\"<em>del Parto</em>\"), la \"Vierge dite de Sainte-Anne\" et la toile du Caravage, la \"Vierge des Pèlerins\" (1605).&#160; &#160; &#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p>",

The gap kept growing; it is said that the world will end when a hay wagon can pass through. In the 1600s, Clarissan nuns built the church of St. Mary of the Snow over the Holy Stone. A nearby chapel houses a healing spring. In 1949 Communist authorities closed the church and repurposed it as a collective farm granary, then as a military warehouse. Its Baroque fittings were looted, its stucco decorations used for target practice, its convent ruined and demolished. Following the 1989 Velvet Revolution, an international effort by German, Austrian, and Czech believers restored the church and chapel and renovated the statue, which had been moved to another church for safekeeping. The annual pilgrimage on the Sunday after August 5, feast of Our Lady of the Snows, which resumed in 1991, features mass in Czech and German, followed by a picnic.",

Our Lady asked the two seers to tell all the people of nearby villages exceptional event, and report that the Most Holy Mother of God specifically asked to come at that lonely place built a church in his honor. To give strength to His message and to dispel any doubt the actual presence of Our Lady, suddenly, on a large chestnut tree, the fruit became ripe. Hearing the news, the priest landowner named John Moroni, happy for this great honor, gathered the elders of Brentwood, the Ossanego, of Fontana, and he gave his farm to build a church in honor of the Madonna. Obtaining the full approval of the diocesan bishop, he began work immediately with the erection of an altar and later, even the church.",

Rosary and knelt in front of a happy \"Capital\" of the Virgin Mary, located at the intersection of the roads for Motta, Oderzo and Redigole. Even the morning of March 9 the Cigana, going to work, he stopped there to pray, and then continued on his way. But soon he stopped, struck by a marvelous vision: sitting quietly on the green wheat in a field, there was a beautiful young girl, dressed in white. Between the old and amazed the mysterious girl, he played a simple and friendly dialogue, then when the Cigana knew it was the Holy Virgin, fell to his knees, as if shot and sat in silence. So in the fresh morning sounded the voice of Madonna full of sadness and pity. She ordered Cigana to fast with the family for three Saturdays and preach fasting and repentance to all the people of Motta and the towns and villages of the land trevisana: Who had fasted with true repentance, he would have received mercy and forgiveness from the Lord, angry for too many sins of the people. To then leave an indelible memory of his beloved land of apparitions in Motta, the Virgin ordered that in that place was to be built a church. Hierzenberger 1996 p 114",

Jerome in fact obtained a release from captivity and the certain death sentence through the intercession of the Virgin, who appeared to him and released him from his chains. The Lady then proceeded to protect him miraculously on his way to Treviso. This allowed him to cross unharmed through armies in conflictun and to fulfill his vow. In fact, he upon arriving at the shrine, he fell exhausted at the foot of the sacred image of Our Lady the Great, sitting majestically on the throne with the Child on her knees. Jerome was in early youth a soldier then, and following the apparitions he received, he dedicated himself to serving others, doing penance and works of charity. At first he lent assistance to the sick and abandoned, later to education of orphans. He founded orphanages in various Italian cities and then, although he was a layman, organized support for the Somaschi Fathers (originally the \"Society of the servants of the poor\", regular clergy). In 1747 Jerome was elevated to the altars by Pope Benedict XIV in 1766 and was canonized by Clement XIII. Finally, in 1928, was declared the patron saint of orphans.

Following the event, he carved a wooden a statue of Mary of about 27 cm similar to her appearance and the statue was then placed near a lime tree. After a while a blind man came to to the place to worship the statue, before which he stopped to pray devoutly. Suddenly, as he prayed with intense fervor, regained the gift of sight. The news of the miracle spread and many devotees immediately came to pay homage to the statue of the Madonna. Pilgrims built a wooden church as a place of worship, then in 1512 a nobleman built a stone church and the the statue was brought inside. The pilgrimage continued to grow more and more. In the seventeenth century, Daniel of Osterberg, in addition to drawing the places of Our Lord Jesus Christ's life and painful passion, also painted this place, inspired by the location between the mountains. He wanted to give the title of this portrait \"Silesian Jerusalem\". In 1723 the church of this place, renovated and enlarged, was elevated to the basilica and in some periods counted annually visited by over 150,000 pilgrims.",

According to what is handed down, the girl, the daughter of peasants, was carrying grazing his cows when at one point he saw the Madonna. She would say \" Autilia, I have chosen to one of the highest business you make will in my name, led by Count Enrico Orsini, in Nola, and tell him that under that bush to the right of my hand, there is a buried my image, for many centuries; I want it to dig the earth and you are building a temple in my honor . \" She went from the count, Autilia was not believed. The next day there was a second appearance in the same place, and this time the face of the youth was marked by a ray of light. Returned the count, this time it was taken seriously, and with the cooperation of Bishop Monsignor Bruno, excavations were undertaken in the place indicated by Our Lady. Here he was found a painting depicting the Virgin between two angels, which was identified as the Immaculate Queen of Victories. Along with the painting he was found a bell weighing about forty pounds, storied inscription \"SS. NICOLAS, Confessor CHRISTI, MARIA VIRGO NOW Pronobis, KAROLUS DEI GRATIA REX SICILIAE\". According to some sources, the Carlo mentioned in the inscription would be Charles II of Anjou , who, after some victory in battle, he would build there a chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas of Bari and the Madonna. Painting and bell would then belong to this ancient building of the thirteenth century [1] . The events of those days were an important event in the history of Liveri, that since then begins a journey to the Marian city, which extends to date [2] . The site of the apparitions became the site of construction of a number of religious structures sovrappostesi over time, and resulted in the current Sanctuary of Santa Maria a wall . In honor of the apparitions, the shrine was placed an inscription that reads still visible [3][4] : DOM Deiparae VIRGINI DECEASED OLIM IMAGO SUB TERRA SEPTA VEPRIBUS Autilia SCALE INDICATING THE DIVINE MONTI, miraculis LATE CLARUIT ET WALL, IN QUO PICTA EST NOMEN habuit YEAR AB EILSDEM VIRGINIS partu MDXIV Pidie IDUS apr?lis [5] About three months after the apparitions Autilia died.

        "description": "On the 10th of August, a woodcutter, John de la Baume, went up to the Verdaille hill. He was alone. As was his custom, he started his day in prayer. When he stood up, he saw a cloud and the Blessed Virgin then appeared with the Baby Jesus in her arms, surrounded by Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, Saint Catherine the martyr, and Saint Michael the Archangel. Our Lady was standing with her feet on a crescent moon. She spoke to John in the following way,\"I am the Blessed Virgin. Go and tell the clergy and the Consuls of Cotignac to build a church right here on this spot in the name of Our Lady of Graces, and have the faithful come here in procession to receive the gifts that I wish to bestow.\" Then the vision disappeared. Was it a hallucination? Whether he doubted or not, John kept the message to himself, which entitled him to a second apparition of the Mother of God! The following day, the 11th of August, standing in the same place to finish his wood cutting, he had the same vision and received the same request. This time, he decided to obey and went down to the village immediately. John was known to be a sober man and both the authorities and the villagers supported him unanimously. In the same year the first stone was laid for the foundation of the church; two years later Pope Leo X approved of worship and pilgrimage.The chapel has been witness to many graces and miraculous signs, most notably the miraculous birth of King Louis XIV - a birth that was difficult to obtain for his royal parents had previously been unable to conceive.",

In the fall of 1521, during his convalescence in the family castle of Loyola, he came into contact with the heavenly world: in that period of isolation, the first ideas of mystical feats began to form in the mind of the young soldier, switching from thoughts of the prowess of chivalry and turning into religious ones. One night, while he was still awake ,he clearly saw an image of the Holy Virgin with the Child Jesus. He received similar apparitions in March 1522 and in February 1523. The apparitions and visions struck him so deeply that they cast a new light on his life. In this period of mystical fervor, Ignatius was brought to \"his inner spiritual truth,\" which help shape his future exercises for the first time. His heart opened completely to the service of God. After healing, he retired into solitude in Manresa, then made a pilgrimage to Palestine and later began the study of philosophy and theology in Barcelona, Alcala, Salamanca and Paris. In 1537, he was ordained a priest and devoted himself to the founding of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), who were at the devoted service of Pope Paul III. Biographies and diaries of St. Ignatius of Loyola tell us that the apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary and our Lord Jesus Christ in his life were frequent.",

In memory of these two apparitions of the victorious battle, a chapel was erected on Mount Gubel which was consecrated in 1559. The Sanctuary was cared for by some hermits until the year 1647, when it was taken over by the Capuchins who had meanwhile founded a nearby convent.",

It was therefore necessary to convert the people who should have been away from the faith... Then Our Lady spoke of Divine Mercy. Botta told the people just what he had seen and heard and was at once believed. A large church was erected on the site and many pilgrims visited the \"Mother of Mercy.\" On March 18, 1660, Mons.

C'est à cet emplacement que la tradition historique situe la première communauté monastique romaine fondée en l'honneur de la Vierge Marie. Marcelline, soeur de saint Ambroise, soeur de saint Ambroise, avait reçu le voile des mains de Libère (+ 366). Elle dirigea ce premier monastère féminin appelé depuis la fin du VIII<sup>e</sup> siècle \"<em>Sainte-Marie de Saint-Ambroise</em>\".</p> <p>Les aléas de l'histoire se firent durement sentir. Ainsi, en 1539, les soeurs de Saint-Ambroise rejoignèrent les Bénédictines du Mont-Cassin. En 1599, une grave inondation élimina les archives de la communauté. Le cardinal Louis Torres fit reconstruire l'église en 1606 à l'intérieur de laquelle on installa un autel décoré d'or et d'argent afin d'accueillir l'image miraculeuse de Marie, \"<em>Notre-Dame de Saint-Ambroise</em>\". Mais la communauté disparût sous la Révolution française. De la Restauration à 1855, des religieuses capucines prirent le relai des filles de saint Benoît. Mais cette communauté fut dissoute à son tour car les soeurs fêtaient publiquement la mémoire d'Agnès Firrao, ancienne supérieure autrefois condamnée par Rome comme fausse mystique.&#160; En 1865, Pie IX confia le monastère aux Bénédictions de Subiaco.</p> <p>On vénérait à l'intérieur du monastère une icône byzantine de \"<em>Notre-Dame de Saint-Ambroise</em>\", oeuvre selon certains de l'évangéliste saint Luc. En réalité, cette image, peinte à la détrempe sur un panneau de cyprès, a été ramenée d'Orient au cours du VIII<sup>e</sup> siècle puis restaurée dans les années 1500-1510. Elle a été couronnée solennellement en 1674.</p> <p>En 1855, lors de la dissolution de la communauté, on croyait que l'icône avait été transférée au monastère des Bénédictines du Champ de Mars, communauté dissoute à son tour en 1914. Aujourd'hui, sa trace a disparue, malgré les hypothèses avancées depuis plus d'un demi-siècle.&#160;</p> <p>Les Bénédictins de Subiaco vénèrent aujourd'hui une fresque ancienne de la Vierge en remplacement de l'image évoquée ci-dessus : la \"<em>Reine des moines</em>\" (<em>Regina Monachorum</em>), découverte en 1846 lors d'un chantier dans l'église Saint-Benoît in Piscinula. Certains affirment qu'elle aurait été aimée connue par saint Benoît lui-même.&#160;</p>",

The fact immediately attracted crowds of people on the mountain Skalnica, this hallowed place that quickly became one of the most visited places of pilgrimage, where was built the first wooden chapel to pay homage to the Virgin Mary.

In digging the foundations was found a prodigious stone slab containing ornaments and the words of the angelic salutation \"Ave gratia plena, Dominus tecum, benedicta milieribus you in,\" engraved on 120 circles, spread over 10 rows. The new church built in the Gothic - Renaissance was consecrated by the vicar general Egidio Falcetta, while the Patriarch of Aquileia, Cardinal Marino Grimani donated to the sanctuary in the year 1544 a picture showing the artistic image of grace and mercy of the Mother of God , attributed to the Venetian painter Jacopo Palma il Vecchio, with the real name Jacopo Negretti. The Cardinal wanted the framework would replace the previous statue and was thus exposed for public veneration, in fact, the beautiful Immaculate from face suffused with an 'ineffable sweetness appears in all its wonderful and compelling perfection and never ceases to attract not only individuals but multitudes of the faithful who follow continuously at his feet.",

Giulia Manfredi, that was the girl was dumb from birth and lived in Vacciago, in a house that still stands today along a lane just before the shrine. That day was the usual cattle grazing nearby, and a chapel in which was portrayed the Madonna Enthroned with the Child in her arms. Suddenly he saw a blaze in the branches of blackthorn (bud in the local dialect) the Madonna and Child. He spoke and said he enjoyed much of his prayers, that soon would welcome in heaven, but that before entrusting her to carry a message to all the inhabitants of the place: Our Lady asked them to solemnize in her honor, as well as on Sundays, Saturday afternoon, and in return would be her special protection. A proof of the truth of the promise and the appearance, Giulia Manfredi purchased the word. When told the neighbors what had happened and what had been commanded, the incredulity was won by another miracle, suddenly the church bells began to ring at the Vacciago party without being touched by anyone. Introduced the custom of the Sabbath rest, just as quickly it was thought the erection of a chapel where devotional still a plaque in 1852 on the roadside which leads to Vacciago Miasino, recalls the descent of the Queen of Heaven. The rush of the faithful and the fame of the place took a little later, from 1628, the erection of a larger sanctuary, which also incorporate the image of the Madonna and Child in front of which stood in prayer at the time of the shepherdess 'appearance.There were also some fragments preserved in a shrine of the bush on which the Madonna had appeared. The sanctuary grew further in size and beauty during the following centuries, gradually assuming its present appearance in the eighteenth century.The church has been adorned by Pope Gregory XVI in 1844 with the official title of \"Sanctuary\".",

The miracle immediately attracted popular devotion and further miracles. The sanctuary in the Poggio district was begun in 1551. The revered image on its main altar, brought from Medicina for the Rogations in 1568 and allowed to remain at the order of the bishop over Medicina's protest, is a 1500s painting of the French school by Giacomo son of Francesco. The Madonna is seated between Sts. Francis & Jerome, in a red robe, blue mantle & yellow-green veil, with a naked Child on her knee. http://www.wherewewalked.info/feasts/02-February/02-22.htm",

        "description": "St. John of God, born in 1495 in Montemor in Portugal, was brought to Spain without having a name, so he was called \" of God.\" Twenty-seven years he was a Christian soldier in the army against the Turks. The legend says that once he fell from his horse and saw Mary dressed as a simple peasant. She helped him and cured him of his injuries. With this event the ground work for hisfor his future conversion was laid and his full dedication to the apostolate of the sick. John lived then as a bookseller in Gibraltar and Granada. Following a sermon of John of Avila, in 1539, he felt very moved and since then decided to devote the rest of his life to caring for the sick. He founded a hospital in Granada in 1540, practiced psychosomatic medicine and devoted himself to healing the physical illnesses of the soul and bringing relief to many patients. To better organize the work of healthcare, he founded the Secular Order of the Brothers of Mercy, which after his death became the Order of Brothers of St John of God's Mercy, who followed the rule of St. Augustine. Papal approval came in 1617. The planned work of the apostolate for the sick developed rapidly and bore much fruit. The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared again to St. John of God, just before his death, leading him to Paradise on the 18th of March 1550.",

She is subsequently said to have appeared to and healed a crippled boy selling buttermilk. A group of Portuguese sailors attribute being saved from a violent storm to her intercession. They constructed a larger chapel at their landing spot in Vailankanni. In gratitude for the miracles that took place, the chapel was replaced by the church, being elevated by Pope John XXIII in the basilica. The feast is celebrated on September 8. 80,000 people including Hindus and Protestants will come each year, and recite the rosary with devotion. This is called the Lourdes shrine in India. Vailankami is now regarded as the Lourdes of India.",

        "description": "One Sunday, September 8th in around 1550, Louise Estivalle was on her way to mass in Azay-on-Thouet, France. She was the lady of the manor of Poupelinière and Leon de Lusivert's widow, remarried to Mr. Darrot in 1548. On her way, she met a beggar who asked her for some bread. She took pity on him, returned in haste to the castle to collect the necessary food, which she gladly gave to the beggar. Her errand had delayed her and she rushed off without further ado. Then she was still two miles from the church, she heard the sound of the bells-it was already the time of the elevation. She knelt down piously and as she stood up she \"saw the Virgin in a dim light\" holding Jesus' inert body in her arms. \"Look towards the church, my daughter. You will see from here the celebration of the Holy Mystery, as though you were actually present,\" she heard the Blessed Virgin say. Louise looked up and \"saw an illuminated altar and a priest raising the consecrated host\". Later, Louise had a shrine built on the site of the apparition. Since the middle of the 16th century, believers have venerated the Virgin at this shine as \"Our Lady of the Kneeler\". Miracle cures have been claimed and on September 11, 1908, Pius X granted a 300-day indulgence to all those who visited the shrine. Still today, the feast day of September 8th attracts hundreds of believers.",

        "description": "The sanctuary of the Montallegro Virgin Mary, near Rapallo, was built in her honour in 1558. According to tradition, the Madonna appeared (2 July 1557) on Monte Leto, to Giovanni Chichizola, a peasant, and showed him a picture of her passing from earthly life, saying that it had been transported by angels from Greece, and that she would leave it on the mountain side as a pledge of her love. The picture was placed in the principal Church of Rapallo for veneration, but two days later it mysteriously disappeared and was again found on a rock at Montallegro. Thereupon the Rapallo people decided that here the Madonna wished the portrait to remain, and they began to build a shrine which was consecrated July, 1558. In 1574 some shipwrecked Greek sailors, recognizing the picture as one which was formerly venerated in Ragusa and which had been missing since 1557, claimed it. After legal proceedings it was surrendered to them but the following day this miraculous painting reappeared in the sanctuary of Montallegro and has since remained there undisturbed. Apparently of Byzantine origin, the portrait represents the Virgin May lying on a bier, surrounded by several saints, and two angels, supporting a representation of the Holy Trinity symbolized by three human bodies merged into one. The feast of Our Lady of Montallegro to whom Rapallo was dedicated, 1739, is observed during the first three days of July. See also: Hierzenberger 1993 p 129",

Refreshed by the pleasant breeze coming from the sea up there, about to doze off when he sees between the branches of a dazzling light and in the center, the Virgin Mary, who tells him: \"Come on, Bertolino, is' in Giulianova and brings the beautiful news that the Great Mother of God has chosen his home here. Warns the clergy who is a solemn procession to honor and here, where now you see me, you have built a sanctuary. \" Stunned for the thrill, but proud for the assignment, Bertolino runs by the Governor of the city to tell him the message of Our Lady. But, as expected, both the Governor that some of the notables present, have a great time listening to the strange story, and when the farmer begins to insist that they follow him on the site of, the hunt in a bad way, and consider him a visionary. Quite miserable for the poor reception received, Bertolino he returns home, and the next day, early in the morning, he went again at the olive tree with the hope of seeing the bright image of the Virgin and to be able to trust all its bitterness. The Apparition back! With my heart in my throat, running along the last stretch of the climb, feels humiliated and offended, not because of the injuries received, but rather the failure of the mission played by Madonna. Come close to the tree, the Madonna is there waiting for him. Encourages and exhorts him to return by the Governor, but also the second embassy had greater success than the first. On the third day, Bertolino back in that place now so dear to him. He kneels down and waits to return the Apparition. The Virgin returns: gently and firmly encourages him to demonstrate to the Governor that what he says is true. Without hesitation, Bertolino returns to town. With courage, for the third time, relates how the Virgin commanded him, and insists that they all go up with him up the hill to check the veracity of his story. But this time the injuries plus the beatings. To better put him to trial, the present resort to violence. The miraculous spring Bertolino, from mild temperament, would have been overwhelmed if Madonna had not intervened to free him! Suddenly, who beats him with his arm remains paralyzed and mute. In the hall hangs a heavy silence! Everyone understands to be witnesses of a supernatural and each, in his heart, he asks forgiveness for the offenses committed against the poor Bertolino. The Governor shall convene the frightened pastor, the Canons, and all, in solemn procession, come at the place determined by Bertolino who, with hearts full of joy, leads the procession to the duke's palace miraculous place. All, trasecolati admire the vision, clear and distinct, the Virgin Mary, shining between radiance of dazzling light. And a great new gift store for them the Madonna, as tangible proof of the extraordinary and lasting event, at the foot of the olive is overflowing with a source of pure, fresh water, which still continues to the relief of many sick! The first miracle is the very man who has beaten Bertolino and made fun of him. Sincerely repented, regaining the word and the use of the arm. The news of the apparition spreads like wildfire and the place attracts a multitude of people to write down with water from the source to invoke mercy, protection and comfort.",

Tell everyone I want to be honored in this place and I'll let my little image fly by angels from Greece as a pledge of predilection. Fast on Saturday.\" John could not move the picture and left it on the mountain. On the way back, with some priests and faithful to see the picture they found a spring flowed where they had placed the feet of Mary. The priests took the picture in the Church, but he disappeared and was again found in the place of the apparition. This happened three times, and eventually left her permanently on the mountain. In December 1574 a ship from Ragusa, the current Dubrovnick, Dalmatia, docked in the port due to a violent storm. The captain and the sailors went to the shrine to thank the Virgin for saving them from the wreckage and were amazed to see the image as it was the same mysteriously disappeared from their land 17 years earlier. After many negotiations were able to take her away, but during the first night of navigation, the image disappeared and reappeared from the ship on the mountain. The Archbishop of Genoa ascertained the authenticity of the facts and on August 6, 1558, authorized the construction of the church and in July 1559 the sanctuary was opened for worship. The miraculous effigy, given by Our Lady to Rapallo in 1557, is set in a lovely pavilion silver and a bar of wood 18 cm by 13, which depicts the Dormition of the Virgin, Death and Assumption of the Virgin the sky. Below is represented the Virgin Mary dead, dressed in a dark robe and lying on a bed covered with a red cloth, and around, the apostles in prayer. Against the sky, there is the Holy Trinity, depicted as three distinct Persons, but together, almost joined to become one, and in the hands of the Holy Trinity where the Blessed Virgin Mary is located. The Holy Father Benedict XVI on the occasion of the 450th anniversary of the Apparition sent a letter to Mons. ALBERTO TANASINI, Bishop of Chiavari.",

They decide to kneel down and pray, and it is at this point that the Blessed Virgin appeared to them. She shakes their hands, comforted by his \"heavenly smile,\" indicates a vein of pure water begins to flow beneath them and invites them to drink.

As in all of Lombardy, the epidemic is spreading also in the Valley Brembilla. The Virgin Mary appears in a dream to another girl named Diana Locatelli, who lives in the village Bura and tells the girl to make the announcement that those who would go to honor her in her new Sanctuary of Foppa, would not have been infected by the disease. The cult of the Madonna della Foppa, was approved by the bishop of Bergamo, Bishop Luigi Speranza that, in a pastoral letter of April 18, 1866 asked for news of \"those places where they occurred or miracles or apparitions of the Blessed Virgin, or are in a particular no worship or church or chapel or image of the Virgin Mary, that in the shortest possible space of time we transmit certified copies of all documents, notes and memoirs written and printed concerning the apparitions, miracles, the worship of B.Vergine, which they were in their archives, and in those respective vestry and they were hanging on the walls, or noted on the books of the sacristy, or you serbassero in some people. \"",

Since1540, he undertook a major reform plan, designing to bring the Franciscan Order back to its roots. Although he was met with much resistance on this path, a Brief of Pope Paul IV approved the reform. From 1556, he became provincial of the Spanish reformed convents, under the patronage of the Province of St. Joseph, and received permission to build new convents in Spain and worldwide. Through the charisma of his high mystical graces, the persuasive power of his preaching, and example of his severe life, he led a life of prayer and atonement. Peter had a great influence on his brethren and the faithful, but also the nobility and the government of his country. St. Teresa of Avila praised the mystical qualities of Peter of Alcantara. His book on contemplative prayer is well known and his aspiration to perfect prayer and meditation. Shortly before his death the Mother of God appeared to him and forewarned of his death. He was beatified in 1622 and canonized in 1669.",

In one of these apparitions of the Virgin, she appeared full of light and predicted the day and the hour of his death. In fact, the next Sunday, he died as Our Lady had predicted, while the bells were ringing the Angelus. Another time, during an apostolic mission in the evening, he was lost wandering the streets and sought the help of the Mother of God. Soon they saw a light in the distance. They ran to the place where the light had appeared, and found a simple home, where they were hospitably received by an elderly man, a young woman and a child. When the two monks woke up the next morning, they found themselves in open countryside near a road known. Then they understood well that Mary had heard their prayers and thanked God, offering prayers of praise. See: Hierzenberger 1997 p 133",

        "description": "Around 1570, the story goes, a woman with distinctive features and a youthful glow began coming from the mountains in the afternoon to buy candles at a market in the Carmona district of Trujillo in western Venezuela. When some curious men asked her why she walked alone, she answered, \"Not alone, but with God, the sun, and the stars.\" \"Where are you from?\" \"From nearby.\" \"How do you cross the full ravine, and who helps you?\" \"My sons, don't forget that I go with God, my protector.\" One day some townsfolk followed her and saw her disappear into a cleft in the rock. Then people noticed the rock sparkling and shining, and decided that the mysterious maiden was not someone from the community, but the Virgin Mary. The Virgin's Rock became a place of legend and devotion. Some said that it was the source of three rivers - one of water, one of blood, and one of milk - that the Holy Virgin held back from sweeping away the town. To this day, large numbers of pilgrims gather at the cueva, cave, to place votive offerings, recite rosaries, and sing hymns in thanks for favors granted, especially around the feast of Our Lady of Peace on January 24. On December 21, 1983, the President of Venezuela, Luis Herrera Campins, dedicated a monumental statue of the Virgin of Peace on the rock above the cave. Designed by architect Manuel de la Fuente, of concrete on a steel frame, the monument weighs 1,323 tons and stands 154 feet high, slightly taller than the Statue of Liberty. The Virgin extends one hand and holds a dove in the other. Visitors can go inside and ascend to five lookouts that survey nearly the entire state of Trujillo. In Trujillo Cathedral is a much older devotional statue of Our Lady of Peace, patron of Trujillo city and state. Information from es.wikipedia.org and other sources.",

Il r&eacute;forma l'&Eacute;glise selon les d&eacute;crets du Concile de Trente (1563). La victoire obtenue par les navires de catholiques contre la flotte de l&rsquo;envahisseur Turc dans les eaux de Lepante le 7 octobre 1571, fut attribu&eacute;e par ce Pape &agrave; l'intervention de Notre Dame du Rosaire. L&rsquo;ann&eacute;e suivante fit institu&eacute;e la f&ecirc;te de Notre Dame du Rosaire. C&rsquo;est dans ce contexte que le couvent Saint Joseph &agrave; Fontanellato avait trouv&eacute; sa mission sp&eacute;cifique : r&eacute;pandre la pri&egrave;re du Rosaire en initiant &agrave; la m&eacute;ditation des myst&egrave;res joyeux, douloureux et glorieux. &Agrave; l'enthousiasme primitif succ&eacute;da une br&egrave;ve p&eacute;riode d'assoupissement, suivi par une reprise irr&eacute;sistible. </p>\r\n<p>L&rsquo;origine du sanctuaire remonte &agrave; 1615. En ce temps l&agrave;, les dominicains reconstruisirent leur couvent et dans son &eacute;glise, ils plac&egrave;rent une statue de Notre Dame du rosaire. C&rsquo;est dans ce climat de ferveur que ce produisit un premier miracle, la gu&eacute;rison d&rsquo;un certain Gian Pietro Ugolotti atteint d&rsquo;une forte et continuelle fi&egrave;vre. D&rsquo;autres prodiges suivirent. Et lorsqu&rsquo;au milieu d&rsquo;un conflit arm&eacute; les dominicains port&egrave;rent momentan&eacute;ment l&rsquo;image &agrave; Parmes, c&rsquo;est le duch&eacute; de Parmes qui re&ccedil;ut le don de la Paix. Une inscription sculpt&eacute;e que XVII&deg; si&egrave;cle indique : &quot;Ex eleemosinis et pauperum pietate erga Deiparam&quot; : autrement dit : ce sanctuaire a &eacute;t&eacute; voulu par les pauvres, ce sont les offrandes des pauvres qui ont couvert les d&eacute;penses de construction et d&rsquo;embellisement. Le nombre de prodiges &eacute;tait tellement &eacute;norme que l&rsquo;afflux des p&egrave;lerins n&eacute;cessita une nouvelle &eacute;glise, (compl&eacute;t&eacute;e plus tard par la fa&ccedil;ade en 1920).</p>\r\n<p>En 1805, Napol&eacute;on 1&deg;, devenu roi d&rsquo;Italie, supprima les ordres religieux et les dominicains de Fontanellato durent partir et se disperser. Alors le conte Stefano Sanvitale intervint et demanda que les lieux soient utilis&eacute;s pour une &eacute;cole accueillant des jeunes filles pauvres, et autres bonnes &oelig;uvres. Les dominicains purent revenir en 1822, jusqu&rsquo;&agrave; ce que la loi de suppression des instituts les chasse de nouveau, en 1866.

But what nature seems to deny flows from a sudden and unexpected intervention of Our Lady. On June 9, 1573, in fact, Jacopina Mariotti, a shepherdess sweet and mild, as well as pious, simple and modest, pray in front of one of the many pictures painted in fresco on the wall, that dot the streets of the plan. After the prayer, you realize you have lost the flock. Her crying apparently had moved the Virgin Mary who, according to a documented tradition, appearing to, the shows where to find him. In addition, the order to go to the rector of the church of the Castle to suggest, in his name, to build a church in the place of its manifestation. After this begins the first movement of popular devotion to Our Lady of the Plan, which will gradually growing more and more. At a distance of just two months after the first event, local authorities, interpreting the will of the people, decided to build a Tabernacle to Our Lady of the Plan and allocate for this purpose the many offers of pilgrims from all over the Valdinievole spill on the site of . Another appearance, this time more crucial and decisive for the erection of the Shrine and the Marian movement resulting therefrom, occurred June 10, 1602 and is witnessed by the Rector of Monsummano Alto Simone Casciani. Also on July 7 of the same year, during the celebration of the Mass flows sudden, after a long drought, a source nova event attributed by the people to the intercession of Our Lady of the Plan long as all invoked. From that day the Madonna del Piano will be called: Our Lady of Fontenova. The explosion of devotion to Mary, already significant after the events of 9 June 1573, it becomes uncontrollable after the events of July 7, 1602, requiring the intervention of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando I de 'Medici. Intervention for the same is ordered that appaltino work del'erigendo Marian Shrine, whose first stone was laid 30 December 1602. On 13 February 1607 the Grand Duke of Tuscany approves the project for the construction of the Osteria of pilgrims at the service of the sanctuary. The June 8, 1608 Cosimo de 'Medici in fulfillment of a vow made by his father Ferdinand gives the sanctuary a crown precious, finely crafted and carved, by the \"jeweler Gallery\" Cosimo Latinos experts is considered the best and most meaningful example of the art of the period chisel Tuscan Grand Duchy. This crown will be placed on the head of the Virgin Mary by the Vatican Chapter in 1782.",

On June 24, the most famous apparitions happened to the blind and lame from birth who, miraculously, got a cure. Back in the country began to knock on doors of homes of friends telling asleep watching and called it a miracle. Then there were other views in the locality of Visora. The place was now a place of pilgrimage, and there arose votive icons, in one of them was a large stone in the shape of a foot referred to as \"The Lady of the Tread.\" In 1862 they built the church but on the evening of July 21, 1921 it was destroyed by fire. In 1958, the shrine was rebuilt in the same place as it is today. Our Lady of Visora is venerated with the title of \"Madonna della Quercia\".",

Suddenly, while he was in contemplation, he heard clearly the voice of Our Lady who told him: \"Come into the Order entitled to my Son.\" Aloisius heard the desire of Mary, and entered the Jesuit Order. He was born in Castiglione, near Mantua, was the eldest son of the Marquis Ferrante and was a page at the court of Florence, where she made a vow of chastity in 1578. Later he was in the court of King Philip II (1581-1583) in Madrid and was appreciated for his qualities of seriousness of life, true devotion and purity. After a long-standing opposition to the will of his father, his father finally had to surrender and granted him permission in 1585 to join the Order. Aloisius was educated in Rome and remained for some time under the spiritual guidance of Robert Bellarmine (later also canonized). During the outbreak of plague in Rome, he took care of the sick and those plagued by evil spirits and died just twenty-four years. In 1605, he was beatified and canonized in 1726 along with Stanislaus Kostka. In 1729, he was elevated to the patron saint of young students.",

        "description": "Saint Mary Magdalene de'Pazzi joined the Discalced Carmelites at Santa Maria degli Angeli in Florence. While seriously ill, a series of mystical experiences of a rare intensity began: the \"Forty Days\", lasting until July 5, 1584. These ecstasies lasted from two to three hours during which time she was able to speak. She received the stigmata, various visions, moral and physical participation in the Passion of Christ, revelations centered on Christ suffering, etc. Her visions of the Virgin are diverse and rich on both theological and symbolical levels. \"It seemed like I could see the Blessed Virgin in Paradise seated on the right-hand side of Jesus; I thought I could hear her say to me while smiling: \"You do not take account of the gift that you received the day when you took the veil.\" This gift from Jesus was the Blessed Virgin's purity. Mary looked so beautiful that my words cannot explain her to you.\" (...) \"I saw two fountains spouting forth from the Virgin Mary's womb, one of milk and the other of blood. The milk was spread on all the blessed souls of Paradise. (...) The blood was spread on all mankind.\" (...) \"I also heard the Virgin pronounce this verse: \"My heart is stirred by a noble theme; I address my poem to the King\" (Ps 45:1). The word coming from her mouth was Jesus, to whom she gave birth in this world for us. And the Virgin was speaking to the King, i.e. to our Heavenly Father. Then I saw an immense fountain, spouting sprays of water, spreading them everywhere in the world and sending forth torrents of grace.\" Saint Mary Magdalene is depicted in art as a Carmelite with the Instruments of the Passion kneeling before the Holy Trinity. Christ crowns her with thorns, the Virgin gives her roses. She may also be shown receiving the Blessed Sacrament from Jesus; receiving a white veil from the Virgin Mary; being presented to or receiving a ring from Jesus; crowned with thorns and embracing a cross, with rays falling on her from a monstrance; or with flames issuing from her breast.",

        "description": "\"The will of God is that you walk in the world like a desert.\" These words, whispered the inner voice during a quiet night, changed the life of young St. Philip Neri. He was also called the \"Saint of Joy ', and developed a great devotion to the Virgin Mary. Neri grew up in Florence and Philip founded the Oratory and the Oratorians. The future saint suffered in his youth the influence of the Dominicans of San Marco. At eighteen, he went to Rome where he was an educator of the children of the Florentine Jailbird Hunt. He led a life of prayer and penance, by cultivating love of neighbor. Philip Neri also received many mystical graces, but he feared, out of humility, that they become visible. Mary appeared to him several times to help him, comfort him, or warn of a danger: when the prestart of the threat of collapse of a once and on another occasion he recovered from a serious illness. In 1548, aided by a simple priest, Persiano Rosa, who would later become his usual confessor, he founded a pious confraternity responsible for assisting the poor and needy pilgrims in particular. This group would then be transformed and grow in the Oratory, attended by some great spiritual figures. The fraternity was born as a continuation of the talks that began in the confessional. The new methods were used in the help of souls: and the spiritual sermons were delivered in the vernacular, pilgrimages to the basilicas of Rome, simple spiritual exercises and prayers of the people; all this, combined with the character of Philip Neri, made him one of the most sought after spiritual leaders in Rome. He had many enemies who were suspicious of his activities (the austere Pope Pius V had monitored his sermons and the \"country walks\"). Soon, however, he was well accepted everywhere and became the trusted adviser of popes and confessor of cardinals. He was linked fraternally to Ignatius of Loyola, Francis de Sales, Charles Borromeo and Lellis Camillo. He was beatified in 1615 and canonized in 1622.",

Most of the decorations were made ??by Francesco de Lorenzi in the second half of the nineteenth century. The large fresco of the half-dome is Charles Orgiero and represents the Apparition of the Blessed Virgin of Mount Bonicca. Towards the '500 sharpened the conflict with the neighboring fief of Masone to the definition of the boundaries. The long conflict resulted in the peace of 1595, which was followed by the tragic events of July 1600. The Corsican soldiers sent to quell the revolt of the people against the misrule of the Spinola family, after a short siege set fire to the village, which was completely destroyed. During the 600 Field came to be populated with the reconstruction of the entire country and the colonization of land more distant from the town, to the ends of the feud. On September 11, 1595, the Blessed Virgin appeared to the inhabitants of Campo Ligure and Masone, two villages in the Valle Stura. The two communities were divided by political motives and by parochial hatreds and 4 centuries were bitter struggle. Between 5 and 9 September 1595, two representatives of the people of Campo went to Vico to implore the grace of the Madonna del Pilone peace. Upon their return to Field, September 10, during vespers in the church occurred unusual phenomena: some of the people fell to the ground unconscious, a woman known as a person idiot, full mystical fervor, he began to speak words of great content spiritual, etc.. The next day he met the men of Field with those of Masone and came to the peace, who celebrated together by participating in a Mass in Masone. After the celebration, everyone saw on Mount Bonicca a white cloud that seemed to consist of a large army of people. This soon vanished, giving way to another equally bright cloud, made ??in the manner of the chapel. Disappearance which appeared lower a woman dressed in blue coat, with one arm out, and a white veil on her head, as they use the nuns, his face shining as much as not being able to fix in the eye.

Canisius and the Order of the Jesuits established themselves as the main defenders of the Roman Church in Germany, Peter was a valuable and respected protagonist of the Counter-Reformation and first considered by Leo XIII, \"the second Apostle of Germany after St. Boniface.\" He dedicated his life to apostolic and received the reward of frequent ecstasy and mystical visions. Among these there was an apparition of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in the days of the profession of his vows (September 4, 1549), when the mystic Jesuit had received this vision at the same time also a Marian apparition, because he was heard to exclaim: \"Even Mary has blessed me. \" So little time before his death his brother heard him say, \"See? You see her? She is here. \" Of course, the mystic again alluded to Mary, who accompanied him in eternity. Peter Canisius had come in contact with the Cartesian Devotio modern spirituality during his theological studies in Cologne. In April 1543, Peter Faber, one of the first companions of Ignatius of Loyola, the proposed retreat for visitors to see clearly his vocation. Canisius was greatly reinforced by the fact these exercises, arrived in 1546 as a Jesuit priest at the consecration, and obtained his doctorate in theology.

Theologian Peter Canisius was active in Ingolstadt, Vienna, Prague, Augsburg, Innsbruck and Monaco of Bavaria, by the Society of Jesus, an important factor for the Catholic renewal in the century of the Reformation. In Rome, Canisius received in 1549 to devote himself to the mission of Catholic restoration, which taken with true joy. The Jesuit theologian dedicated his life to the apostolate in all its possible forms, opposed the reformers not only in terms of doctrine, but also on the pastoral in which he was tirelessly active. Gave wide circulation to Marian confraternities, especially in the Jesuit colleges. Also promoted the spread of the recitation of the Rosary and Litany. He was also active in teaching catechism to children and young people, in sermons and in visits to the sick. He took the Christian doctrine to the people and the poor peasants, even in the most isolated rural areas. He worked also for the development of the Germanic College, founded by Ignatius in Rome. \"The Apostle of Germany\" was in conflict with his disciple Karl Hoffaus issues that regulated the tributes of private revelations and controversy and possession. Canisius represented the conservative positions within the Church, which were criticized by the \"modernist\" because they are not suited to the times. He was sent to Freiburg where he established a new College. In 1577 his book on the Virgin Mary was released, a tribute to the defense of her virginity and a deep devotion to Mary. Peter Canisius was canonized and declared Doctor of the Church by Pope Pius X1 in 1925. 141",

Mais elle a remplacé une statue de la Vierge encore plus ancienne, aujourd'hui perdue.</p> <p>Un récit traditionnel raconte le fait suivant : la statue aurait été découverte par un paysan à l'intérieur d'une niche, dans un vieux pan de mur qui aurait appartenu autrefois à un oratoire chrétien. A trois reprises, avec l'aide du curé de la paroisse, il aurait essayé de mettre l'objet à l'abri mais à chaque fois l'oeuvre mystérieuse regagna son emplacement initial ! Une voix aurait été perçue : \"<em>Pitié ! Pitié !</em>\" C'est l'origine du nom du sanctuaire.&#160;</p> <p>Une petite chapelle fut édifiée sur place, ruinée dans la seconde moitié du XVI<sup>e</sup> siècle par des soldats protestants puis remplacée par un nouvel édifice, béni le 29 novembre 1604 par Mgr Geoffroy de Saint-Belin, évêque de Poitiers.&#160;</p> <p>En 1794, la Pietà fut mutilée : la tête du Christ fut détaché du corps. On l'a mit à l'abri et on la rendit à la vénération des fidèles quelques décennies plus tard. Elle a été couronnée par le cardinal Mgr Pie, évêque diocésain, en 1873. Elle est installée aujourd'hui sur un piédestal, à la droite du choeur, en remplacement de la statue d'origine. Elle a été restaurée en 2001.</p> <p>A partir de 1891, le chantier de l'église actuelle débuta. Faute de moyens, il dura jusque dans les années 1920.</p> <p>En 1926, on démolit l'ancienne chapelle pour permettre l'édification du nouveau choeur. L'ensemble, de style néo-gothique, a une capacité d'accueil de plusieurs centaines de personnes. Cette église fut érigée au rang de basilique mineure par Paul VI le 1<sup>er</sup> mars 1964.</p>",

She replied, \"Mater admirabilis\" and accompanied this attribute of praise with a look of love. Since then, Jacob always repeated this invocation three times to his disciples.

The two did not dare to ask the abbot and spent much time at this supernatural event. John Mayr was married and had a dumb son. One day he went to the spring in the woods for a walk with his son and suddenly, with full joy of the father, the child received the gift of speech. Then he remembered the assignment entrusted to him by Madonna all those years ago and, feeling very guilty for not doing anything, from that time he worked with all the energy to fulfill its mandate. After a difficult drawing, the church was built in that place of grace also for the influence of miraculous healing, visible to all.

In the fall of 1597, after overcoming some obstacles, managed to open a school in Santa Dorotea pious folk for the education of poor children. The news spread quickly throughout the Trastevere district. This was the first free school for poor children in popular throughout Europe, open and carried out with financial support of Pope Clement VIII and the assistance of the members of the Christian Doctrine. In 1617 Paul V confirmed the age-old organization as \"the poor Pauline Congregation of the Mother of God of the Pious Schools\", in 1621 Pope Gregory XV made ??a congregation vows to the title of high order. Calasanzio was the first general of this Order, as \"Joseph of the Mother of God.\" The religious organization received a resounding success. Calasanzio was beatified in 1748 and canonized by Benedict XIV in 1767 by Clement XIII.",

He looked around and with great awe he saw the radiant Lady with a Rosary on her right hand and a Child on her left as she stood on a cloud veiling a treetop. The man fell on his knees. He told the people of the apparition. And soon right on the spot where the Lady appeared a chapel was built. A town quickly flourished around it and was called \"Manaoag\". Tradition has it that the town itself was born from the Virgin Mary’s call, thus the term, \"taoag\" meaning \"to call\" was used to name the town. This is where the name Manaoag was derived from, which means \"She Calls\". During World War II, the Church suffered moderate damage. 4 bombs were released on top of the church. 3 bombs landed on the plaza and the facade, destroying them both. One bomb landed in the sanctuary, but failed to explode. The church was rebuilt, and today, it is an active parish serving Manaoag and the surrounding area.",

She did this and returned with several people and at the request of Our Lady handed her some rosaries and the belt and upon receiving them back, was cured of her eye condition and could see clearly. This was the first recorded Marian apparition in the country. From the miraculous cure of her eyes during the apparition, the well water, now known as “Balon ng Sta. Lucia” and the adjoining stream, now known as “Banal na Tubig” have been known to possess miraculous attributes of healing to this day. An arch with pediment was constructed after 1611 over the wells, which generally marks the spot of her apparitions, and is today called “Banal na Pook”. On February 24, 1620, Augustinians issued an order to construct a church \"in the same place and site as Caysasay, visita of Taal, as it has been verified through serious investigation that the Most Holy Virgin has appeared there. It is resolved, likewise, that it be given the title of Nuestra Senora de la Misericordia.\"",

Orsola Benincasa, founder of the Teatine Hermits, was crying about the ruin of sinners when she saw the Madonna and Child, dressed in white, covered with a cerulean veil and she said: \"Cease from crying, silent sighs in sweet joy, and listen to what Jesus is going to tell you.\" Jesus then told her that he wanted erect a hermitage in honor of the Immaculate Conception, where 33 virgins, dressed as the Virgin Mary, living out a penitent life, promising extraordinary graces; Orsola dared to ask the same graces for those who, being in the world, professed a sincere devotion to the Immaculate, and, living chastely according to their state, as a sign of subjection to Mary, wore the dress of the Virgin Mary. Jesus looked with favor on her prayer and showed her a multitude of angels intent on spreading everywhere the custom of wearing the cerulean dress, accompanied by abundant and wonderful graces. - It is to be imposed by an authorized priest.

        "description": "One of the most famous devotees to the cult of Most Holy Lady was the mystical Peruvian Isabella Flores, then known as Rose of Santa Maria (1586-1617) or more commonly Saint Rose of Lima. Since her childhood she felt particularly drawn to a painting of Our Lady of the Rosary Church in Lima. She often went to pray before this image to be enlightened and helped. Rosa received a response several times of the comfort of the Mother of God. The Church Inquisition imposed a thorough examination to be held by her confessor, prior of the Dominican convent of Lima, Fr. Di Lorenzano. The confessor, supported by the consultant for mystical theology, Dr. Juan Castillo, Rosa was asked how Mary had told her about the image of the painting, and she then she says: \"In a silent language without words, without sound and without movement the lips. Her image of the painting of light rays emanating at times thin by which I understand with the intellect, what about the inner Most Holy Virgin, in a deeper way than by a clear vision or words. \" From the hagiographic information of that time we learned she that was in the habit of making twice a year a wonderful dress for the Mother of God. In one of these occasions, the mystic said: \"I Rose of the Mother of God as an unworthy servant of the Queen of Angels, with the help of God sewed a dress for her.\" Embroidered on the gown were six hundred Hail Marys, Salve Reginas as well as many dates and festivals dedicated to the glory of fifteen pilgrimages in the mountains to visit Santa Elisabetta. The velvet and the skirt hems still contained six hundred Ave with an equal number of Salve Regina in glory at the inner joy for the birth of the Divine Child. Rose of Lima was a Dominican tertiary, was beatified in 1668 and was as the first American canonized in 1671, was proclaimed patron saint of Peru and then all of South America, India and the Philippines. \"The Queen of the Rosary\" of Lima was chosen by the King of Spain, Philip IV, as a patron and protector of the country, from 1668, the patroness of Latin America. It is celebrated on August 30.",

There followed numerous expansions and renovations that led to today's complex of buildings. The main event which is celebrated at the shrine is dedicated to the miraculous fact behind its construction, which is celebrated on August 27. ====== The history of the Sanctuary of Prascondù, dedicated to Our Lady of Loreto, dates back to the fall of 1618, when John Berardi, a lively and hard-working boy, went with his father to Pavia, to help him work and earn a bitter morsel of bread. One cold winter evening, after a tiring day at work, the father invited John to join him in prayer. But that night, John refused because he was tired. The father slapped him and cursed him to silence. To the father’s despair, the curse worked and the boy was silent. Imploring the grace of Our Lady, he made a vow to pilgrimage to Loreto if cured.

Many people flocked to the area. Even without official church sanction, native devotion was quick and spontaneous. Miraculous healing powers were attributed to the waters from the spring.

She sought refuge with a statue of Mary near the family home. When she was sixteen years old, Blessed Virgin Mary appeared near the statue and said: \"Catherine, you're poor, I am also ... I am poor and rich at the same time because I dwell in heaven but am homeless on Earth. But when someone loves my Son, I take all lodging in his heart, but if it takes a mortal sin, I am cast out ... Go to St. Corentin Cathedral and take (the first bishop of Quimper) as your priest and protector. She then return often to me! \" From that day Catherine was miraculously guided by the Blessed Virgin. Once the Mother of God said: \"The greatest happiness that can happen to a human being is to suffer for Jesus, mortified in your honor, in your possession and in your body.\" Is exactly what happened: Catherine was stigmatized and became a mystical bride of Jesus Christ. Atoned, she patiently took upon herself the pain and suffering of our Lord, and was dedicated to the development of popular missions for the poor souls of the dead and in Purgatory. With these sufferings repeatedly she enjoyed the consolation of the Blessed Virgin and her words.",

In her fruitless searching she came across a Lady sitting on a rock, who asked her: - Woman, why are you crying? What is the matter? At first the village woman did not answer, but she decided to tell about her plight. The Lady advised her to go home and look for the keys in a certain place. Much to her surprise the keys were in the place mentioned by the Lady. Then, she returned happily to the same place where she found the Lady, \"very beautiful and shining\", seated on the same rock. This time the Lady introduced herself: \"I am the Mother of God and I want you to go to the people in the village and tell them to build me a church here with the name of Our Lady of the Sands; and whoever comes here and invokes my name, I will free them of seizures, fevers, and malaria.\" In those times of great superstition there were many people who began to scrape the boulder, trying to get sand to make tea with to cure their ills. The local bishop intervened by giving orders to have the stone taken to his house in Aljubarrota. Strangely, the bishop discovered the next day that the stone had disappeared and returned to its original place. Convinced that someone had stolen it, he had it brought into his room so that he could better watch the steps of any intruder.

In the final days of Spetmenber of 1630, he returned to Groscavallo.

Before her are the crown of thorns and the nails.[2] The icon of is painted on a canvas framed in carved wood. The painting itself is set with gold and silver accouterments and precious gems, which are ex votos from her devotees. An inscription found at the back of the painting says: \"A doze de Abril 1692 años Juan Oliba puso esta Stma. Ymagen Haqui\" (\"On 12 April 1692, Juan Oliba placed this most holy image here\"). It is considered an invaluable treasure inherited by the Caviteños, and is the oldest extant dated Marian painting in the Philippines. A legend narrates that many years ago, a small detachment of the Spanish Guardia Civil was stationed at a garita (little garrison, or sentry post) located at the end of the Isthmus of Rosario. One stormy night, a Spanish sentinel was at his post and he perceived a bright, shifting light. A dazzling apparition rose form the currents of Cañacao Bay, startling the sentry with suspicion that it could be pirates out to raid the port (at the time, Cavite was at the peak of economic prosperity because of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade). Frightened, the sentinel shouted, \"¡Alto! ¡Alto!\" (\"Halt! Halt!\"). Instead of stopping, the light proceeded toward him. Hence, in a loud voice he asked, \"¿Quién vive?\" (\"Who is there?\"). He then heard a sweet and melodious voice reply: \"Soldadito, ¿por qué el alto me das en noche tan fría? Dame paso. ¿No conoces a María?\" (\"Little Soldier, why halt me on a night so cold? Give me passage. Thou knowest not Mary?\") The sentinel, struck in awe and confusion, humbly and repentantly replied, \"Perdóname, Virgen María, Reina de mi devoción; pues solo soy un soldado que cumplo mi obligación!\" (\"Forgive me, Virgin Mary, Queen of my devotion; I am but a soldier that complies with my duty!\") The following morning, fisherman and workers at the Cavite Royal Arsenal passed through the Porta Vaga (Vaga Gate) and found a framed image of the Virgin on the beach along Cañacáo Bay near the place of her earlier apparition. They brought the image to the parish priest who temporarily installed it in the parish church. Later, a small chapel was built near the Porta Vaga's walls, and for three centuries it was the icon's shrine. The icon was used to bless the galleon plying between Cavite and Acapulco, Mexico during formal sending off ceremonies, earning her the title \"Patroness of the Galleon.\"",

        "description": "The Holy Virgin appeared to Lady Elizabeth Amic during the night and in the time of her sleep, beneath the pleasant face of a beautiful pilgrim, dressed in a poor and worn-out first garment, beneath which was a green velvet robe. surrounded by a silk belt of the same color. She had a laughing and shining face, and wavy, golden hair floating over her heavenly face, whose rare beauty filled Elizabeth's soul with admiration and astonishment. Her eyes shone with a bright and soft light, which along with the pleasant features of her face, exuded a charm that inspired Elizabeth's love. On her head was a little hat, and above it a crown of gold enriched with diamonds and pearls. The Lady Caille, praying the pilgrim to go up to her house, she said to her: that first she wanted to go to the church to pay homage to God. She recited her prayer with her, after which they both returned to the house. Then the lady invited thevisitor to rest and have some food; which she refused, saying that the reason for her visit was only to cure her of her ills and to ask her for a dress, since the first of which she was covered was worthless. Having obtained promise of this dress, the visitor disappeared. At six o'clock, Lady Caille, whose heart was still alive with the memory of the marvels she had seen and the pleasure she had felt at the beautiful sight, could not remain silent in the morning. She spoke to her husband, on waking, of all that had happened. As she was finishing her story, six confreres from the chapel of the white penitents knocked at her door, bearing this holy image of Our Lady in a box covered with green taffeta, where she had been sent. They came to show it to her, and to pray to her husband, who was allied to the master of the glass-works, who was two leagues from Bargemon, to procure for them a glass casket to lodge her, while waiting for her to procure some richer dwelling. . Lady Caille, who was still in bed, refecting on her wonderful vision, having heard this, exclaimed immediately that beautiful pilgrim was surely the holy Virgin, who had appeared to her and spoke to her during the night, and whose husband she had just spoken of. She begged him to leave at once and go himself to the glassworks to have a statue created and to make a silvercase to hold it, with the jewels she offered. This miraculous image is now in this shrine of money with the weapons of Sieur Jean Caille, still alive. He himself told me and testified the truth of this event confirmed and made public by the healing of his wife, who was delivered from all her ills, despite the doctors thinking she was nearing the end of her life. She regained her color to the astonishment of everyone and asked that they praise the Virgin Mary for this recovery. This miracle, the first of all those who have been made since the possession of this holy image, evidently shows that the mother of God wished to be honored and served in this city of Bargemon; what she has blessed with numerous miracles.",

On November 3, 1637, as he was saying matins in his cell around 2 am, he heard a baby crying and looked around to find himself before the the Queen of Heaven, softly radiant, seated on a throne, with three crowns atop her shoulder-length hair, dressed in a starry blue gown, and holding a wailing child in her arms: \"Have no fear,\" she said. \"I am the Mother of God, and the child you see is the Dauphin God wants to give France.\" Two hours later, Mary showed herself again, alone, and said, \"Don't have any more doubts about what you told your confessor. To confirm that I want you to advise the Queen to make three novenas in my honor, behold my image at Notre-Dame de Grâces, in Provence, and the appearance of the church.\" Brother Fiacre saw precisely the scene and the choir where the image was (as it is today in Cotignac). He ran to tell his superiors who, never having been to Cotignac either, consulted some friends who'd made the pilgrimage; the descriptions corresponded. The King and Queen, childless after 22 years of marriage, were informed, but while they awaited the Cardinal's approval, Brother Fiacre started the three nine-day prayer petitions in the Queen's name. Nine months after they ended, Anne of Austria gave birth to the future Louis XIV. Louis XIII and Anne of Austria sent him to Cotignac to offer up prayers. \"Apparitions et Pélerinages\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Volume VI. p. 269 Robert Appleton Company. 1907",

The tradition goes back to Christmas of 1641 when Hendrik Busman von Geldern was absorbed in prayer before a cross on the moors. Suddenly he heard the voice of Madonna said: \"In this place I need you to dedicate a chapel.\" Mary repeated twice more this desire to Hendrik and his wife saw a chapel illuminated in a dream. The couple conviced the pastor, James Schink, to build the chapel from the dream. When this was built, a small image of the Madonna, a copy of the \"Comforter of the Afflicted\" (Our Beloved Lady of Luxembourg, cf. 1627), was used. This small chapel soon became a point of attraction for the devotees. Around this place of Marian worship various churches of vast proportions were built over the centuries, although they were modest in terms of art. Today, about 600,000 pilgrims visit the shrine every year. Hierzenberger 1997 p 160",

Il s'agit d'une manifestation de Marie de type 'privé', sans messages ni enquête canonique.

Then take my statue and bring it to Taferlberg at Marbach on the Danube, then leave it under an oak tree.\" The man did so, took the statue and placed it in the hollow of an oak tree there. After a few days he recovered. Between 1658 and 1661 were seen near the oak numerous apparitions of red and white figures, which, in the light of day as the darkness of the night, hovering in the air, some went to the edge of the woods. During the night the stars illuminated the statue with heavenly light and several candles burned before they appeared. Many people of all ages, even other religious confessions, witnessed these miraculous phenomena. The Bishop of Passau organized a commission of inquiry wo interviewed fifty-seven people who then confirmed under oath what they had seen. Recognized as a supernatural phenomena, in 1660 he set the first stone of the sanctuary. On the two-hundredth anniversary of this event, eight hundred faithful and two hundred faithful priests went on pilgrimage to Maria Taferl. The pilgrimage is still very active.",

Soon after he devoted himself with great fervor to the mission and the establishment of popular seminaries. In 1648, he was pastor of Sannt-Sulpice, where he founded his famous seminary for priests. Jean-Jacques was blessed with unusual graces and appearances. In 1649 Mary appeared to him and induced him to resume his life dedicated to prayer, that he had forgotten for a few days. Moved by the mystical graces and the messages of Mary, the servant of God was able to reinvigorate and revive the ideal of the priesthood through his seminaries and theological and ascetic writings. He exerted a great influence on the renewal of the clergy. In 1664 a seminary for priests according to his design was approved as a congregation and spread rapidly in France, America and Africa, as the Sulpicians. In these communities of priests, was put into practice the spirituality and mysticism of the French Oratory. The main points of the spiritual world of Olier was the cult of Most Blessed Sacrament and the Blessed Virgin Mary, the total stripping of oneself in God and the full consecration to Christ. A summary of his whole spirituality is found in the Catechism of the Christian interior life. Semi-paralyzed, dedicated the last years writing spiritual works.

        "description": "When the city of Guanare (capital of Portuguesa state) was founded in 1591, the Indian tribe who inhabited the region, the Cospes, fled to the north jungle. Then the evangelization of that lands began. The first apparition of the Virgin Mary was in the forest where the Cospes had fled, on September 8, 1652, when the Virgin appeared to the Cacique (ruler) of the Cospes Coromoto and his wife, saying in his own language: \"Go to the white house and ask them to pour water into their head to go to heaven\"; then, the Virgin asked him and his tribe to be baptized. According to oral tradition, Cacique Coromoto told the encomendero don Juan Sánchez about this vision, saying that after eight days of a brief teaching of cathechism, the entire tribe would had been ready to receive baptism. Several indigenous Cospes converted and were baptized, but not the chief, because he did not feel at ease: under a new religion he feared not to be recognized as the legitime chief. Indian Chief Coromoto fled, and took refuge in the forest, the Virgin appeared to him again, and Chief Coromoto, blinded by anger, raised his arm to order the apparition to grab and go. This appearance was confirmed by a miraculous mark made of wood fibers, which were then searched and found. The relic is venerated today in the National Shrine of Our Lady of Coromoto. Cacique Coromoto told the story that he was bitten by a poisonous snake and returned to Guanare wounded and near death, and began to ask in order to receive baptism, which was administered in Barinas region. He got baptized, became Christian and asked the remnant of the group of rebel Cospes Indian under his command to be baptized. Then, after several years, the Chief Coromoto, now with the Christian name of Angel Custodio, died of old age. See also Hierzenberger 1997 p 164 [More on this apparition]",

The chapel was immediately built on site of the apparitions and the statue was unearthed on the inside. A huge mass of pilgrims traveled to this shrine to venerate the statue of Mary.

Paid a small fee there, went along to the high Dezzo Scalve. His appearance was quite good, but an insidious disease, tuberculosis, undermined his life. A dry cough that occasionally tormented him, appearing to conflict with the robust stature and bronzed face of the pastor. He arrived shortly after the place called \"Fontane\". There the valley bifurcates and one branch leads to Schilpario and the other at Manina. There were some fountains (which gave its name to the place) and a small chapel in which was painted the Madonna with Jesus in her arms. He stood with his flock. He was terribly tired. When suddenly spat blood, a second, third, and another. He saw himself lost, also because the place was deserted, the first houses away. Leaning on his stick, raised his eyes imploring the Blessed Virgin appeared to him that he looked from his chapel, and ... wonder!, next to the chapel sees a noble lady who is smiling and shining. The vision is coming, china hand in the fountain, touches his forehead and exclaimed: \"It's heart, dear son, you're cured.\" At the time of the miracle were other new arrivals that randomly came to drink there. The curate of St. Andrew Don Duci of Bareilly and two other people is a tradition that he was a lawyer with his servant. Bartholomew Burat is like beside himself with astonishment and joy. A dream, a hallucination? No, no, it was the Virgin Mary, the dear Mother of Jesus that has touched with wet hands fountains of water, that has spoken, that has healed. It feels like another man, full of energy and health, instantly and completely healed.More about this apparition",

The family had gone to church. The image was a rudimentary fresco, walled up the wall on the porch, who represented Mary with Child, this fresco was up to 1648 in the house near the river that had been sold to pay off a debt. Destroyed the house by the new owner, the fresco was miraculously saved and Giacomuzzi carried it into your new home. While the girl was praying absorbed, suddenly, he was rapt in ecstasy. When he recovered his senses he found himself completely healed and told family members that he saw a beautiful lady dressed in white with these words: \"I saw there, next to the picture, a beautiful lady, dressed in white, who smiled at me and calling me. When I was close to the good lady said to me: \"I'm not good in this place, where blasphemy against My Son, of 'your father that he be converted and that makes me carry in a church, on a public road; warn the others of the villa to refrain from the sin of blasphemy. For because of this huge impiety were devastated by hail your campaigns in recent years and are hanging over your head even more terrible punishments; obey all my notes and in this day forward you will not be exposed to the insults of evil that so far has harassed you \". Soon the news has great resonance and reaches to the nobles of the nearby St. Vitus. The family Giacomuzzi decides to accede to the request to transfer to the miraculous image of St. Vitus and provides their oxen for transportation, that is established for the Second Sunday of Easter of the same year (31 March 1655). At the gates of San Vito, near the Church of St. Nicholas outside the walls, the oxen are locked and refuse to continue, despite repeated beatings. The event is interpreted as a clear indication of the Blessed Virgin to keep your image in that Church. It spreads immediately worship and devotion to the image of Our Lady of Rosa, which are attributed to repeated miraculous events. Over the centuries the Church has repeatedly enlarged and embellished to become an important shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Rosa. On 22 March 1945 a final and terrible bombardment completely destroyed the sanctuary and save the bell tower, on which are also evident, even today, the signs of splinters. Among the piles of debris is found, miraculously intact, the image of Our Lady of Rosa. After the war, thanks to the work of the Franciscan friars and the generosity of many of the faithful, we construct a new sanctuary on the opposite side of the highway (463), along which stood the previous year. Even today, the Sanctuary of the Madonna di Rosa is a destination for many pilgrims and reference point for the faithful of the right and left Tagliamento.",

He realizes that the blood flows wicker branches he has just cut. The news spread in the region; this mystery attracts many people who come to see the miraculous wicker, become a source of devotion. In 1657, this same Pierre Port-Combet plows his field when a beautiful lady appears. It asks him to change his life and leave his Protestant state for the Catholic. This encounter leads to conversion of peasant to the end of his life, convinced that he saw the Virgin who gave him grace. At the time, the hamlet Les Plantees has twenty inhabitants. The appearance of the Virgin in 1657 is peddled well beyond the borders of the Dauphiné and made of wicker a stamping ground. Miracles follow one another to the rhythm of pilgrimages. The village has been initially occupied by the priests of the church unworthy behavior. They will remain in the history of the \"bandits of Ozier\" (with z at the time). They were happily replaced by the Augustinians came from Vinay then by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, until 1997 date of departure of the priests will still reigned 350 years in the service of \"sanctuary\".

        "description": "Ursula Giuliani was a Franciscan nun who has been described as the most representative figure of Baroque mysticism. Born Orsola Giuliani in Urbino of a comfortable middle-class family, after seeing the Blessed Mother in a vision, she determined to become a Capuchinnun at Città di Castello in Umbria in 1677 against her father’s wishes. She took the name Veronica and had a difficult novitiate because of the severity of her superiors. She is said to have had numerous mystical experiences, including several visions of Our Lord in which she received the stigmata, including those of a crown of thorns on her head. The bishop, in an effort to rule out the possibility of fraud, subjected her to many more trials. She was not allowed to be alone for one moment and she was forbidden to receive Holy Communion. She was not allowed to talk with any of the sisters except those assigned to watch over her, and she was not allowed to communicate with the outside world. Her hands were put into gloves with the fastenings sealed with the bishop's signet. She served as mistress of novices for thirty-four years and abbess for ten, leaving behind a ten-volume spiritual diary. Veronica died on July 9, 1727, and was canonized in 1839. Her feast is not on the General Roman Calendar, but it is celebrated by the Franciscans on this day.",

        "description": "The Blessed Virgin Mary often appeared to the abbess Maria Jesus of Agreda (1602-1665), in the family home of this mystic. The Venerable Mary of Agreda with her mother, sister and other women, had transformed the house into a Franciscan convent. In 1627, the visionary was chosen as the abbess and received special graces from Our Lady. Along with many inner experiences and visions, she has left us above all the voluminous work Mystical City of God - Our Lady's life (or the life of the Blessed Virgin and Mother of God appeared to Mary of Agreda, abbess of the Convent of the Immaculate Conception). This work is described as internal visions that are the highest level of mystical experience. In these visions, the abbess is not talking, but it is only a \"channel\", a chosen vessel, through which flow the heavenly apparitions. All the experiences described in the Mystical City of God were then translated into over twenty languages. Of course there were also a number of enemies who, driven by strong rationalist positions, declared the private apparitions of the abbess to be regarded as impossible and a result of the individual imagination. But the positive approvals were many: the decrees of Popes Clement XI and Innocent IX, some bishops approvals, appraisals of the theological faculties of Toulouse, Salamanca, Alcala and Lowen and numerous positive statements by famous theologians and men of the Church. In 1673 the process of beatification of the mystical abbess was begun. In 1849 Mary of Agreda's body was found still incorrupt. The visions also contain an explanation of the common life of Mary and Jesus are comparable to those of the great mystics such as Gertrude the Great, or Bridget of Sweden, or the wonderful visions of Anne Catherine Emmerich, or Jacob Lorber and Theresa Neumann in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Particularly valuable are the real explanation that Most Holy Virgin offers from time to time in response to questions from the abbess.",

        "description": "Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque, was blessed with apparitions of the Blessed Virgin as a child. In 1655, at the age of eight years, lost his father who was a judge and notary, well known. After his father's death, Margaret had much to suffer: the fifth of seven children, she was placed in a boarding house in Charolles at the Poor Clares. Living among the sisters, she discovered the peace of the cloister, and, on the occasion of her first communion, she realized the depth of her mystical consciousness of the conflict between the peace of God and the turbulence of the world. She was often ill, immobilized by rheumatism, making?a vow to the Virgin to become \"one of her daughters', if she were healed. These years of suffering prepared her sanctification. In June 1671, after overcoming many obstacles of a practical nature, Margaret Mary Alacoque recovered and kept her promise to the Mother of God and entered the convent of the Visitation at Paray-le-Monial. The convent that she chose was living in conformity to the thought and the inspiration of Francis de Sales. Margaret became a chosen one of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom he received great graces. The mystic nun was one of the most fervent ambassadors of the message of the Sacred Heart of Jesus",

        "description": "In 1686, a curious happening shook up the village of Celles in the region of Ariege, near Foix: four women violently beat a priest. The priest took the case to court and obtained justice. On May 28, 1686, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, a young peasant boy named John Courdil was coming back from the fields reciting the rosary. He suddenly saw a white pigeon in front of him. As the bird got closer to the boy's farm, near a fountain, it changed into \"a six or seven-year old girl dressed in white\" (statement of July 21, 1686). In his second statement (July 28, 1686), John said that he first saw the pigeon \"three times in front of him,\" then the girl just \"five or six feet from him.\" John was afraid and he tried to flee. \"Do not be afraid, my child,\" he heard a voice say, \"I am the Holy Virgin.\" He knelt down, the apparition did the same. \"Warn the people to change their lives and make eight processions so that the people convert. Otherwise, all is lost [...]. Continue to serve your father and your mother as you have always done.\" The apparition added that the four women responsible for the public disorder must do penance. She asked John to leave his spade near the fountain where she assured him that the water would be good. When he came back to recuperate it, he would find a \"sign\" on the end of the handle. John ran quickly home to the farm and asked his brother and sister to go back and retrieve his spade. The youngsters found it \"standing straight up with three cross-shaped oak leaves coming out of the top of the handle.\" The four women made reparation for their wrongs and people went in procession to the place of the miracle. In early July, the Virgin appeared a second time to John, in his bedroom. \"You did what I asked you to do well, and the fountain will be good; the people have corrected themselves well,\" she told him. A commission of inquiry has identified twenty-eight cures from the water of the fountain. In October 1686, a second inquiry mentioned seven new cases. The chapel of Pla-Rouzaud was built by the poor villagers and blessed on September 8, 1695 by Monsignor de Verthamon. The renown of the shrine Our Lady of Celles spread widely and attracted believers from the entire region and even from Spain. The pilgrimage, which takes place to this day at the restored shrine on the third Sunday of July, is marked by evangelical simplicity and Marian humility.",

En 1687, le synode diocésain de Zagreb prescrivit un jeûne sévère au pain et à l’eau pour la veille de la fête de l’Immaculée Conception. Bien avant le dogme de 1854, beaucoup d’églises étaient dédiées au dogme de l’Immaculée conception. Les bibliothèques sont remplies de livres chantant Marie.</p> <p class=\"IntertitreDeArticle\"><br /> Le sanctuaire de Marija Remete</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">A 5 km de Zagreb, le sanctuaire de Marija Remete est sans aucun doute le plus antique. Depuis 1288 Marie y est invoquée comme la libératrice des prisonniers. Sur les parois du sanctuaire, les chaînes et les cordes évoquent ces histoires de délivrances. Le tableau vénéré représente la Vierge entourée d’anges et de sainte Catherine, sainte Barbara, sainte Agnès et sainte Edwige. En 1812, elle reçut le titre « Avocate très fidèle du règne croate ».</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">&#160;</p> <p class=\"noteDeArticle\">___________________<br /> Attilio GALLI, Madre della Chiesa dei Cinque continenti, Ed.

        "description": "The Madonna's intervention saved Messina during the earthquakes that shook most of Sicily in 1693. On January 9 of that year, when the first tremors began, the Virgin Mary appeared to a sick girl named Paola Alfonsina, daughter of jurist Antonio Pesce. As Benedetto Chiarello, S.J., wrote in 1705, \"Suddenly she saw the window of her little room open unexpectedly, and through it came a marvelous woman dressed in white with a blue mantle\" who smiled at her and said, \"Fear not.\" The Madonna returned during the night and, asked to protect the city, replied that the people should remain joyful and wait in the cathedral before the altar of the Madonna della Lettera. Followed by a tsunami along the entire coast, the January 11 earthquake left 54,000 casualties. Messina suffered damage and flooding but was was spared the brunt of the disaster. Afterwards, the Madonna reappeared to Paola with words of comfort and over the next few days to others as well. Local tradition holds that the Virgin honored the people of Messina by writing a letter to them, dated from Jerusalem, \"in the year of her Son, 42.\" The Byzantine icon of the Madonna della Lettera, behind a golden cover, occupies the high altar of Messina's Cathedral, which was founded around the fourth century and used as a stable during the Islamic occupation, then reconstructed around 1168 and consecrated on 22 September 1197 to the Virgin Mary. The Madonna of the Letter is now also represented by a completely gilded statue in the belltower and by a 20' monument at the harbor entrance, with the huge inscription: \"Vos et ipsam civitatem benedicimus\" (\"We bless you and your city\"), from the letter's text. The harbor statue was unveiled on August 2, 1934 and, thanks to Gugliemo Marconi, fitted with a special device allowing it to be illuminated from the Vatican in Rome. The feast day of Our Lady of the Letter is June 3. www.messinaweb.eu http://www.wherewewalked.info",

        "description": "Feast Day: Third Sunday of November A legend narrates that many years ago, a small detachment of Spanish Guardia Civil was stationed at a sentry post called garita located at the end of the Isthmus of Rosario. One stormy night, while a Spanish sentinel was at his post, he perceived a halo of a bright shifting light. A dazzling apparition rose form the currents of Cañacao Bay startling the sentry with suspicion that it could be pirates who were out to ransack the port because that time, Cavite was at the peak of economic prosperity because of the galleon trade. Frightened, the sentinel shouted \"¡Alto! ¡Alto!\" (\"Halt! Halt!\"). However, instead of stopping, the light proceeded toward him. Hence, in a loud voice he asked, \"¿Quién vive?\" (\"Who is there?\"). He then heard a sweet and melodious voice saying: \"Soldadito, ¿por qué el alto me das en noche tan fría? Dame paso. ¿No conoces a Maria?\" (\"Little Soldier, why halt me on a night so cold? Let me pass. Dost thou not recognise Mary?\") The sentinel, struck in awe and confusion, humbly and repentantly replied, \"Perdóname, Virgen Maria, Reina de mi devoción; pues solo soy un soldado que cumplo mi obligación!\" (\"Forgive me, Virgin Mary, Queen of my devotion; for I am a soldier who complies with my duty!\") The following morning, fisherman and workers at the Cavite Royal Arsenal usually passed through the Porta Vaga (Vaga Gate) found along the beach of Cañacáo Bay a framed image of the Virgin. It was close to the spot where she appeared the previous night. They brought the image to the parish priest who temporarily installed it in the parish church. Later, a small chapel was built near the Porta Vaga's walls, and for three centuries it was the shrine of the Virgen de la Soledad. The icon was used to bless the galleon plying between Cavite and Acapulco (Mexico) during formal sending off ceremonies, earning her the title \"Patroness of the Galleon\". In 1929, a new parish priest, Fr. Pedro Lerena y Lerena of Logrono, Spain, was assigned to the Puerto. At the same time, he was appointed Rector of the Ermita. His great dedication to the cause of the Virgen de la Soledad saw the beautification and the improvement of the Ermita through the years. During the Second World War, Fr. Lerena was able to retrieve the precious image of the Virgin from a junkyard where it was thrown by the Japanese invaders and brought it to the Archbishop’s Palace in Intramuros, Manila and later to the vaults of the Philippine National Bank for safekeeping. It was brought back to Cavite only after the liberation in 1945, this time to her home at the San Roque church because the Ermita was destroyed by Japanese and the combined Filipino-American forces. Until his death in 1972, Fr. Lerena served as the guardian of Cavite’s priceless treasure.",

The apparition lasted throughout the recitation of the Gloria, Our Father, and Hail Mary. Then it faded and the cloud covered the image. Afterwards, the bishop got better, and when fully recovered he authorized devotion to Our Lady of the Cloud, erecting an altar to her in Quito Cathedral.

Antonio was mocked for his faith and tortured with a fire burning under his feet for many hours. Near the end, Antonio cried out from the cross. The Virgin appeared to him at his side!

        "description": "St. Louis Marie Grignon de Montfort (1673-1716) was an extraordinary mystic, prophet and apostle of the fervent Marian devotion. Its greatest merit is that he has introduced countless people to the love of the Blessed Mother of God and the practice of Marian devotion. Marian devotion of his inspiration presupposes two elements that combine in one body inseparable: the perfect practice of true veneration of Mary and deeper commitment to Jesus, ie the total consecration of themselves to Christ through daily rededication to Mary. On June 5, 1700 Grignon was ordained priest. In 1701 he became a chaplain at the hospital for the poor of Poitiers of which, after various vicissitudes, was appointed director. From 1706 he devoted himself to parish missions for the people, his true vocation, and founded the Daughters of Divine Wisdom, a hospital dedicated to the Order of Most Blessed Virgin Mary. He was a missionary traveling throughout France, and during these trips was often accompanied by the appearance of a \"Lady dressed in white.\" The apparition was seen by some believers. From the prayers of St. Louis Marie Grignon, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, is the profound influence of these apparitions. Because of the persecution of the Jansenists, who at that time dominated the public and ecclesiastical life, his writings for a long time could not move. Only much later, his treatise on True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin (Traité de la Sainte Vierge à la vraie devotion), which was written in 1842, was widespread. The complete works of Louis Grignon first spread to France and England, then across the German-speaking world, thanks to the publications of the Swiss publishing house Canisius. Grignon was beatified in 1888 and canonized by Pope Pius XII July 20, 1947. The encyclical Ad diem istum, written by Pope Pius X for the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the declaration of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, all written in the spirit of Grignon de Montfort, has promoted the link between the cult of Mary and the modern apostolate. From careful investigation on the mystical Marian Grignon clear the relationship with that of Berulle and Henry Suso.",

But soon it became clear that, to accomplish the task entrusted to him by Mary, would have to go another way. He then retired for some time in solitude to devote to prayer and atonement and understanding his true path in the world at this time drew up a \"rule\". From his spiritual father, Francesco Arborio, bishop of Alexandria, received the black robe of atonement. Pope Benedict XIII allowed him to seek other brothers, but rejected the rule because too severe. Paul devoted himself to the care of the sick with his brother and was ordained priest in 1727. With some brothers retired to Monte Argentario, where he founded the first home of the Passionists. Benedict XIV approved a less severe form of the rule. During an apparition, Mary Paul explained to the meaning and nature of his pain and induced him to contemplate the sufferings of his Son. Through the spiritual schools of Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, Francis de Sales and John Tauler, Paul developed a deep passion of the mystic, who through his sermons, also spread among the faithful and contemporary spiritually prepared. At his death the Order of the Passionists had 12 offices with over 200 members. Paul was beatified in 1863 and canonized in 1867.",

His story, handed down to us in detail by Canon Colombero , began August 18, 1713 when a certain Lorenzo Nicol broke his leg in an area called the Lower and, turning to Mary, vowed to build a pylon there. Immediately healed by divine intervention, the Nicol was able to return to the country and, as often happens, he forgot the promise. On August 20 of the following year, working in the same locality, Lorenzo Nicol was affected by the same disaster. Repented of his past behavior, he prayed to the Virgin Mary because, once again, came to his aid. Our Lady answer the prayers of our workers and allowed him to reach his home. The Nicol no longer disregarded the vow. He built a pylon which formed the origin of the sanctuary and placed in it a statue of the Virgin Mary still worshiped there. The source from which the Colombero took the news about what happened to Lorenzo Nicol in those years, dating back to a script left by the theologian Joseph Bertolo of Mompellato in which the author comments on the fact exceptional. The local people, became aware of the miraculous event, wanted to build a Lower chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows, which replaced the shrine, and where he celebrated his first Mass in 1721. In the following years the building was enlarged to reach the current structure consists of a building, used as a shelter for pilgrims, and the real church consists of three naves, one of which is located in the Municipality of Val della Torre while insist on remaining estate of Rubiana. Permits for use of municipal land were granted, and communicated via two letters of concession in 1879, by then Mayor of Val della Torre, Sig.Chiaberge, Sig.Presidente to the Shrine of the Low.",

He would have to pass by Guarantinqueta, a small city in the Paraiba River valley. The people of Guarantinqueta decided to hold a great feast to honor the Count, and a lot of fish would be needed. However, it was not the season for fish and the water seemed deserted. After many hours of catching nothing, the fishermen were very depressed. Among the fishermen were three men who always prayed to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception -- Domingos Garcia, Joco Alves, and Felipe Pedroso. Before going out to fish, they asked God to help then in this difficult task, to find enough fish at this time when no fish were available. Felipe knelt and prayed, along with his companions, \"Mother of God and our Mother, we need to find fish!\" Just before they were ready to give up, Joco cast his net one more time near the Port of Itaguagu in hopes that they would find fish. However, they found a body of a statue! Joco called out in surprise, \"Domingo! Felipe! Come and see what we have!\" They cast the net one more time and brought up the head of the statue! They very carefully washed the statue and saw that it was Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. They wrapped her in some cloths and continued to fish. Domingo commented, \"We worked all night and have found no fish!\" Felipe had a proposition: \"Let's continue to fish with faith in the Virgin Aparecida (who appeared).\" From this moment on, the net became very full with fish. This was the first miracle of Our Lady of Aparecida. It is not known how the small (less than three feet high) statue came to rest at the bottom of the river, but its artist is known, Frei Agostino de Jesus, a \"carioca'' monk from Sao Paulo who created artistic clay sculptures.The image was made around 1650 and must have stayed submerged in the river for many years because it lost its original polychromy. The image is now a brilliant dark brown color, and is covered by a stiff mantle of richly embroidered thick cloth, allowing only her face and hands to be seen. She wears on her head the imperial crown with precious stones with which she was crowned by the Apostolic Nuncio in 1904. In 1930 Pope Pius XII proclaimed her principal patroness of Brazil. Her feast on October 12 is a national holiday. Pope John Paul II visited the Virgin \"Aparecida\" in her much frequented sanctuary and gave it the title of Basilica. A few days before the visit someone got hold of the statue and threw it forcibly on the floor. Although the frail image was broken into many pieces, the loving and careful work of several artists put it together again and the Virgin, \"Aparecida\" returned to her niche in the Basilica.",

The shepherdess then began to cry out: \"Mary, Jesus, help me.\" As soon as she uttered these words, the Virgin Mary appeared before her with a white veil on her head, and thus addressed her: \"You called Jesus and Mary for help and they will help you ... Do you promised once again to visit Our Lady of Caravaggio? But do not go to Caravaggio! Go rather to the Feast of the Ascension of Christ in the chapel of St. Anne in Montagnaga. There you will find a portrait of the Blessed Virgin by Caravaggio. Kneel down and address your prayers with a sincere heart to Jesus and Mary, then you will see miraculous things. \" Sunday shewent to the chapel of St. Anne in Montagnaga, while praying fervently, she again had an apparition of Mary. The robe of the Blessed Virgin radiated a golden light shining, crowned with a diadem on her head and gave off rays of clear light, even the Child Jesus, who was in his arms, he was dressed all in gold. In the right hand of the Madonna holding a crown, she said: \"I am Mary, the Mother of the Lord. Please tell this apparition to the local priest. Do not be afraid! Nothing bad will happen to you. I will be with you. In my name you must announce that every year on this day is set up a feast. \" Only a few believed the story and especially the priest showed himself very skeptical. In another appearance, the Virgin said on Sunday: \"I chose this place as the throne of my Mercy. Those who care to pray there with living faith and grace will not return home empty-handed. Take care that a church be built for large mass flow to my devotees. \" After other vicissitudes, in 1730, an ecclesiastical investigation was ordered on the case which resulted in a positive opinion. A sanctuary was built and consecrated in 1750. She led a life of deep Christian devotion and died in 1764.",

Son origine remonte à 1538 lorsque une confrérie (dite de \"<em>la Mort</em>\") chargée d'enterrer dignement les disparus les plus démunis nait dans la Cité éternelle, les services municipaux chargés des inhumations n'existant pas encore. En 1552, Jules III approuva ses statuts et la baptisa : confrérie \"<em>de l'Oraison et de la Mort</em>\", car, dans l'esprit du pape, il s'agissait aussi de prier pour l'âme des défunts (le 3<sup>e</sup> dimanche de chaque mois, devant le Saint-Sacrement). En 1560, cette confrérie fut érigée en archiconfrérie. Saint Charles Borromée en fut membre.</p> <p>En 1575, une nouvelle église fut édifiée par ses membres Via Giulia. En 1577, on y installa au-dessus de l'autel une image de la Vierge peinte à l'origine sur le mur du palais du duc César Gloriera. L'oeuvre est enchâssée à l'intérieur d'un tableau de Philippe Zucchetti montrant l'archange saint Michel délivrer les âmes du Purgatoire, en présence de saint Charles Borromée. L'image a été rapidement jugée \"miraculeuse\" et fut couronnée en novembre 1661.</p> <p>Entre 1733 et 1737, une nouvelle église (consacrée le 13 novembre 1738 par Mgr Christophe de Almeyda, membre de l'archiconfrérie) remplaça l'édifice originel. Le 1<sup>er </sup>mars 1781, Pie VI accorda une indulgence plénière à chaque messe quotidienne célébrée en ce lieu.</p> <p>L'action de l'archiconfrérie a perduré jusqu'en 1896, date à laquelle 8600 défunts avaient été pris en charge par ses soins depuis 1552.</p>",

The only salvation of crops and animals, it would rain. Night fell and the couple hurried pace with their sheep and goats. Suddenly, both spotted not far away, a glow; onlookers stopped before heading into the light. As they approached, the light is to multicolored rays intertwined giving a wonderful view. Both were engrossed watching the play of light that gradually gave way to a beautiful image of the Virgin Mary on the top of a pepper tree , typical of the area tree. Fell on their knees and kissed the ground exclaiming \"Madonna mine, thank God!\" Looking up they saw that the image was gone. The next day at the first light of dawn, went to the place of occurrence: there was the image. They took her to his ranch , placing it in a place of preference. Once anoticiaron neighbors came to the house to honor the Blessed Virgin, but found to his surprise that the image had disappeared. Quickly all went to the place of the apparition. Indeed, the image resting in leafy tree, wrapped in a light beam. On his knees, prayed all night, and were joined by other villagers with torches and bonfires, accompanying the image, and promised to build a chapel on the spot. At dawn the next day the settlers built the first chapel , where enshrined the image of the Virgin of Chaguaya. In the 1980s they built the current sanctuary, which was declared a basilica . The devotion to Our Lady of Chaguaya is widespread in southwest Bolivia , both among locals and among parishioners neighboring departments, and even among residents of northern Argentina . Between August 15 and September 14 , a lot of believers are addressed in pilgrimage from the city of Tarija.",

        "description": "It has been reported that George Washington received a vision from a Lady while at Valley Forge, and that she gave him a prophecy. The account of Washington’s vision appeared in a newspaper article first published in the National Tribune in 1859 and reprinted in 1880. Later reprinted in The Stars and Stripes newspaper owned by the National Tribune, in 1931 and the latest printing on December 21, 1950. The vision was related to a reporter named Wesley Bradshaw by an officer who served under General Washington at Valley Forge, named Anthony Sherman. This vision has never been historically confirmed, and there have been some who have made somewhat feeble attempts to discredit it. Thus, it is worth a mention in this paper. In the vision, Washington sees three great trials that the future country of America would face. The vision showed him images of what would later be the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and the greatest threat, a war fought on the soil of the United States as the final conflict near the time of Jesus’ return to reign on the renewed earth. Here is an excerpt from the vision about the final conflict: And again I heard the mysterious voice saying, ‘Son of the Republic, look and learn.’ At this the dark, shadowy angel placed a trumpet to his mouth, and blew three distinct blasts; and taking water from the ocean, he sprinkled it upon Europe, Asia and Africa. Then my eyes beheld a fearful scene: from each of these countries arose thick, black clouds that were soon joined into one. Throughout this mass there gleamed a dark red light by which I saw hordes of armed men, who, moving with the cloud, marched by land and sailed by sea to America. Our country was enveloped in this volume of cloud, and 1 saw these vast armies devastate the whole country and burn the villages, towns and cities that I beheld springing up. As my ears listened to the thundering of the cannon, clashing of swords, and the shouts and cries of millions in mortal combat, I heard again the mysterious voice saying, ‘Son of the Republic, look and learn.’ When the voice had ceased, the dark shadowy angel placed his trumpet once more to his mouth, and blew a long and fearful blast. Instantly a light as of a thousand suns shone down from above me, and pierced and broke into fragments the dark cloud which enveloped America. At the same moment the angel upon whose head still shone the word ‘Union,’ and who bore our national flag in one hand and a sword in the other, descended from the heavens attended by legions of white spirits. These immediately joined the inhabitants of America, who I perceived were well nigh overcome, but who immediately taking courage again, closed up their broken ranks and renewed the battle. Again, amid the fearful noise. of the conflict, I heard the mysterious voice saying, ‘Son of the Republic, look and learn.’ As the voice ceased, the shadowy angel for the last time dipped water from the ocean and sprinkled it upon America. Instantly the dark cloud rolled back, together with the armies it had brought, leaving the inhabitants of the land victorious! Then once more I beheld the villages, towns and cities springing up where I had seen them before, while the bright angel, planting the azure standard he had brought in the midst of them, cried with a loud voice: ‘While the stars remain, and the heavens send down dew upon the earth, so long shall the Union last.’ And taking from his brow the crown on which blazoned the word ‘Union,’ he placed it upon the National Standard while the people, kneeling down, said, ‘Amen.’ The scene instantly began to fade and dissolve, and I at last saw nothing but the rising, curling vapor I at first beheld. This also disappearing, I found myself once more gazing upon the mysterious visitor, who, in the same voice I had heard before, said, ‘Son of the Republic, what you have seen is thus interpreted: Three great perils will come upon the Republic. The most fearful is the third, but in this greatest conflict the whole world united shall not prevail against her. Let every child of the Republic learn to live for his God, his land and the Union.’ With these words the vision vanished, and I started from my seat and felt that I had seen a vision wherein had been shown to me the birth, progress, and destiny of the United States.",

        "description": "The pious nun Anne Catherine Emmerich is famous for her mystical gifts and holy stigmata, including a bloody cross on her chest which appeared on August 28, 1812 and every Wednesday thereafter. She was born in 1774 in Flamske at Coesfeld (Westphalia). In 1802, after overcoming some difficulties, she entered the Augustinian convent of Agnetenberg to Diilmen. Since childhood she had the gift of a profound religious and cosmic consciousness and received many visions of heaven: the angels, the Church triumphant of heaven and earth and the suffering of the Church, the communion of saints, of Jesus Christ, His Life and His sorrowful Passion, the Madonna and her life, her ancestors and parents, Joachim and Anna was often seen among the Essene community. The servant of God was accompanied spiritually in her travel in Purgatory, by her guardian angel that was next to her on many other occasions. The seer was also accompanied by the sacred souls of Clare of Montefalco, Juliana of Liege, St Rita of Cascia and her deceased sister, Clara Sóntgen; also was often comforted in the expiatory sufferings of St. Ignatius and St. Augustine, from which she drew useful lessons. Her mission of atonement and perpetual dedication to the poor souls in Purgatory, for all the suffering of the Earth and for the renewal of the Church, was rewarded by the Lord Jesus Christ by grace more sublime than the holy stigmata. Anna Catherine was subjected to strict examination and inspection by the ecclesiastical commission and temporal investigation systems used many times very cruel (even came to get their fingers in the wounds). Finally, all were agreed in the certificate the absence of every possible trick and recognize the stigmata of the pious nun as truly supernatural. The writings in the diary of her physician, F.W. Wesener, from doubting Thomas to become faithfully devoted, try the heroic virtues and special mystical gifts of the servant of God: no power, knowledge of human hearts, recognition of the relics of saints, knowledge of medicinal herbs, all the mysteries of the Bible faith, participation in the spirit in the afterlife, all thanks to knowledge infused by the Holy Spirit. From 1819, until the day of her death in 1824, the visions of Anne Catherine Emmerich were carefully recorded in about sixteen thousand sheets from the German Romantic poet Clemens Brentano (who later converted to Catholicism). The poet sat almost continuously for about six years by the side of the pious nun. The bitter sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ was published by Brentano himself, knew the other visions long after many editions and were translated into major languages. A part of the mystical visions still remain unpublished. In the book The Life of the Virgin Mary and The Poor Life of Our Lord Jesus Christ have documented numerous contemplations Marian, in furtherance of our knowledge about the earthly life of Our Lady. The collection of views on the life of Mary. Especially can be considered a veritable treatise on mystical Marian (comparable to the visions of Mary Agreda, and Teresa of Konnersreuth and partly also to those of St. Bridget of Sweden and Jakob Lorber). In the summer of 1823 Anna Catherine had reached the limit of her strength. In these last days she gave her outlooks on life and Passion of Jesus, while contact with the Holy Virgin was becoming more alive: \"She who honors the glorious Mother of God will be encouraged by her devotees who will intercede for her at the Divine son. During the temptations should put his image on the chest. \" The pious nun died in the embrace of of the mystical sufferings of Our Lord on February 9, 1824. In 1892 her cause of beatification was Introduced , which is still ongoing. She so loved the Blessed Virgin Mary, that she imitated her virtues with deep devotional fervor, was able to relive her life in its smallest details, and endure the same suffering in silence as the heroic true mystics.",

Upon inquiring why, Our Lady answered, “Behold, my daughter, such great ungodliness.” Blessed Elizabeth then saw “apostates brazenly trying to rip her most holy Son from her arms. Confronted with such an outrage, the Mother of God ceased to ask mercy for the world, and instead requested justice from the Eternal Father. Clothed in His inexorable Justice and full of indignation, he turned to the world. “At that moment all nature went into convulsions, the world lost its normal order and was filled with the most terrible calamity imaginable. This will be something so deplorable and atrocious that it will reduce the world to the ultimate depths of desolation.” When Pope Blessed Pius IX authorized Elizabeth Canori Mora’s cause for canonization to proceed, for years, all her writings were scrupulously examined for doctrinal errors, to guard against the dangers of being misled by a false mystic. The ecclesiastical censor commissioned by the Holy See released his official judgment on November 5, 1900. It stated “there is nothing against faith and good customs, and no doctrinal innovation or deviation was found.”",

        "description": "<p class=\"SecondLigneGrisRouge\">L'église Notre Dame du roc</p> <p>Célèbre par son pèlerinage et par les faveurs spirituelles extraordinaires dont elle jouissait au moyen-âge, l'église de Montautour est dédiée à la Sainte Vierge fêtée à la Visitation. Elle occupe une position très pittoresque au sommet d'un rocher dans lequel elle est littéralement enclavée, ce qui lui a valu le nom de Notre-Dame-du-Roc. L'ancien édifice se composait d'une nef séparée du choeur par un arc triomphal et accostée d'une seule chapelle au Sud. En 1836 on reconstruisit le chanceau et l'on ajouta une chapelle au Nord. Mgr de Lesquen vint en 1837 bénir l'église ainsi restaurée et agrandie. En 1858 on ajouta au bas de la nef la tour qui existe encore ; carrée à sa base, elle devient ensuite octogone et se termine par une galerie et un dôme que surmonte la statue de la Sainte Vierge. Mais, en 1867, une partie de la nef s'étant écroulée, on résolut de reconstruire l'église tout entière ; on adopta pour cela un plan de style roman moderne, conforme à celui de la tour, et en 1872 l'édifice se trouva achevé. C'est une simple croix avec chevet droit ajouré de trois baies. Les transepts ont des fenêtres géminées et la nef a trois travées. Le tout est voûté en arête. L'autel de Notre-Dame, enrichi de nombreux ex-voto, témoigne de la dévotion des pèlerins et des grâces qu'ils y obtiennent.</p> <p class=\"SecondLigneGrisRouge\">Origine</p> <p class=\"troisiemeIntertitre\">Le don du prêtre Raoul</p> <p>Vers l'an 1040, la cure de Montautour appartenait à un prêtre appelé Raoul, qui l'avait reçue comme un bien de famille, mais qui n'en était pas moins un personnage vénérable et d'une grande piété. Ce prêtre, aspirant à la perfection, voulut se faire moine, et dans ce dessein il alla trouver l'évêque de Rennes, appelé Main, et le pria de lui indiquer à qui il devait laisser son patrimoine. Main l'envoya alors à l'église de Saint-Sauveur de Redon, lui prescrivant de donner tous ses bien d'origine ecclésiastique à ce Sauveur même duquel tout homme attend son salut (Cartulaire de l'abbaye de Redon, 243). Raoul se rendit, en conséquence, à Redon, et il donna à cette abbaye l'église, la cure et la paroisse de Montautour avec tous ses biens, terres, revenus et droits de toute sorte, « ecclesiam Sancte Marie de Montaltor cum omni parrochia sua, cum terris, silvis, pascuis aquarumque decursibus ». Et pour qu'aucun de ses parents et héritiers présomptifs ne pût se prétendre lésé par cette donation ni en contester sous ce prétexte la validité, Raoul leur donna immédiatement tous ses autres biens, puis il se fit moine au monastère de Redon (Cartulaire de l'Abbaye de Redon, 243).</p> <p class=\"troisiemeIntertitre\">Confirmation de la donation</p> <p>Peu de temps après, en 1047 ou 1049, eut lieu à Rennes le couronnement solennel du jeune duc de Bretagne Conan II ; à la fin de cette cérémonie, l'évêque Main fit un beau discours qu'il termina ainsi : « Nous venons d'honorer notre prince terrestre ; maintenant honorons notre prince céleste, en priant le prince terrestre de daigner, avec ses barons ici présents, confirmer le don naguère fait sur mon conseil, et par un de mes prêtres, à Notre Sauveur Jésus-Christ et à son église de Redon ». Il s'agissait précisément de la donation de l'église de Montautour, qui fut confirmée aussitôt par le duc Conan, par Goscelin, vicomte de Rennes, Robert, baron de Vitré, Goranton et Hervé, son fils, tous deux parents de Robert. Cette confirmation fut faite en présence et de l'assentiment de plusieurs autres seigneurs du pays. La terre de Montautour donnée par Raoul fut reconnue par le duc et ses barons libre de toute redevance sauf envers l'église de Redon, excepté toutefois 5 sols de rente dus à Goranton et payables à la Nativité de la Vierge, pour son droit de garde, et 8 deniers dus à l'évêque de Rennes au synode de la Pentecôte. Elle fut aussi érigée en fief avec juridiction seigneuriale, et les habitants furent déclarés ne relevant plus que des moines. Arnoul, archidiacre de Rennes, et tout le Chapitre de cette ville se joignirent au duc de Bretagne pour approuver ces actes, et l'évêque Main fulmina solennellement la peine de l'excommunication contre quiconque prétendrait porter atteinte à la précédente donation (Cartulaire de l'abbaye de Redon, 244).</p> <p class=\"troisiemeIntertitre\">Transfert du privilège de se substituer au pèlerinage de Rome</p> <p>Le vénérable Pérennès, abbé de Redon, était aussi présent ; et comme il se réjouissait de l'heureuse issue de cette affaire, il vit venir à lui l'évêque de Rennes, le baron de Vitré et plusieurs autres seigneurs du même pays, qui tous ensemble lui présentèrent une requête. L'église abbatiale de Redon jouissait alors, par concession du Souverain-Pontife, d'un privilège singulier, établi pour le plus grand avantage spirituel des fidèles qui résidaient entre la Loire et la Manche : c'est que tous les habitants de cette partie de la France, qui, ayant fait voeu d'aller à Rome, s'en trouvaient empêchés par une cause légitime, pouvaient accomplir leur voeu en se rendant, trois fois dans la même année, en pèlerinage à Saint-Sauveur de Redon. A la demande de l'évêque et des seigneurs, Pérennès communiqua ce précieux privilège à l'église de Montautour, et c'est là sans aucun doute l'origine du pieux pèlerinage, encore à la fin du XIXème siècle fort en vigueur, de Notre-Dame de Montautour, autrement dite Notre-Dame-du-Roc.</p> <p class=\"SecondLigneGrisRouge\">Informations pratiques</p> <p>La commune de Montautour fait partie du canton de Vitré.

        "description": "A story was told by Mme. Durie, who wanting to donate a huge amount to the Curé was conducted to the presbytery. As she went up stairs she heard two voices in his room. One voice was saying with infinite gentleness: \"What do you ask?\" The other - the Curé replied, \"Ah, most loving Mother, I ask for the conversion of sinners, the consolation of the afflicted, the relief of the sick, and more particularly of a person suffering for a long time and now praying for death if she cannot be cured.\" It was Mme. Durie that the Curé was talking about. \"She will be cured, but not yet\", said the voice. As she could not contain herself any longer Mme. Durie pushed the door open. And there she saw the Most Holy Virgin, of middle height, clad in a robe of dazzling white, sewn with golden roses. Her shoes seemed to be white as snow. Her hands gleamed with the richest diamonds. Her brow was circled with a crown of stars shining like the sun. Mme. Durie was dazzled! When she lifted her eyes to Hers, Our Lady smiled sweetly. There are many other wonderful stories about the Curé and Our Lady but it will make our story longer. And so it was his greatest joy at that time when Pope Pius IX proclaimed the Immaculate Conception a dogma. See also Hierzenberger 1997 p 193",

        "description": "Justine Bisqueyburu was born November 11, 1817, twenty-two years as a postulant entered the Congregation of the Daughters of Charity, founded by St. Vincent de Paul and Saint Louise de Marillac. The superior general of the congregation, in the circular letter of New Year's Eve 1905, wrote of Justine, \"Sister Bisqueyburu had a particular devotion to the Blessed Virgin, a devotion that shone in the words and how fervently praying the rosary.\" Our Lady appeared six times to Sister Justine Bisqueyburu the following dates: January 28, 1840, February 8, 1840, August 15, 1841, September 13, 1841, May 3, 1842, September 8, 1846. The Mother of God had her heart in her right hand surrounded by flames and in the left scapular or rather a sort of half of a scapular (remember that one a medallion scapular proper). The Mother of God urged the servant of God to introduce and spread this \"green scapular\" in honor of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Ten years after the apparitions received from Catherine Laboure, this sister of the Order of the Vincentians came into contact with the Holy Virgin. The Green Scapular on one side, an image of the Virgin and on the other, a heart on fire with glowing rays of the sun, pierced by a sword and surrounded of an inscription, oval-shaped and topped by a golden cross , bears these words: \"Immaculate Heart of Mary pray for us now.\" The color green symbolizes the confidence in the omnipotence of the merciful Virgin Mary before the throne of God. Sunday September 8, 1846 Holy Mary addressed Sister Justine in Versailles and revealed the meaning of the scapular: \"If the scapular will be taken with confidence give rise to a large number of conversions and will provide a good death for the infidels. \" Pope Pius IX in 1870 approved the scapular. Since then, many prayers have been answered, many conversions have occurred first and miraculous healings of serious illnesses (especially cancer and lung disease). This scapular does not presuppose any membership in a religious order or brotherhood, in no confession nor to Christianity. It can also be given to people far from God to love and recommend them to Mary. But those who wear the scapular must recite the following prayer: \"Immaculate Heart of Mary pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen \". --------- On January 28, 1840, the Virgin appeared to Justine Bisqueyburn, orginally from Mauléon, postulant at the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent DePaul. The apparition asked her to love her \"Immaculate Heart\". On February 8, 1840, the Virgin appeared and gave her the Green Scapular. The apparition occurred again on: August 15th and September 8, 1846 (always in Versailles). In 1855, Sr. Justine went to Constantinople to treat the wounded of the Crimean War, then to Algeria from 1858 to 1867, as the superior of the miltary hospital of Dey. Pis IX approved the green scapular devotion in 1870.",

        "description": "On the night of December 24, 1841, not long after Fr. Pierre De Smet started St. Mary's mission with the Flathead Indians in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana, an orphan boy went to an old woman's tipi to study prayers in preparation for baptism Christmas day. As Little Paul, 11, told Fr. De Smet not long afterwards, he saw someone wonderful there: \"Her feet did not touch the earth, her garments were as white as snow; she had a star over her head, a serpent under her feet; and near the serpent was a fruit which I did not recognize. I could see her heart, from which rays of light burst forth & shone upon me. When I first beheld all this I was frightened, but afterward my fear left me; my heart was warmed, my mind clear, and I do not know how it happened, but all at once I knew my prayers.\" Unsure if the radiant visitor was a man or woman, Little Paul said that the same person had come to him in sleep, \"pleased that the first village of the Flatheads should be called 'St. Mary.'\" Fr. De Smet identified the boy's helper as the Blessed Virgin, and the following year, on May 31, had a statue erected at the apparition site, dedicated in procession on Corpus Christi as Our Lady of Prayer. Sadly, within ten years Little Paul was dead and the mission closed. Jesuits built a new St. Mary's Church there in 1866, which closed in turn in 1891 after the last of the Flatheads were moved to a reservation 45 miles north. In 1921 St. Mary's reopened as a parish church. The chapel of 1866 has been renovated as part of St. Mary's Historic Mission, a nondenominational tourist attraction run by a private foundation. Next door is St. Mary's Parish Catholic church, built in 1954, with stained-glass windows depicting the mission's history.

She is best known for starting the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus which is now one of the approved Catholic devotions and for the Golden Arrow Prayer. From 1844 to 1847 Sister Marie of St Peter reported that she had visions of Jesus and Mary. She said that in 1844 she had a vision in which Jesus told her: \"Those who will contemplate the wounds on My Face here on earth, shall contemplate it radiant in heaven.\" She reported that in her vision, she saw Saint Veronica wiping away the spit and mud from the face of Jesus with her veil on the way to Calvary. She said that sacrilegious and blasphemous acts today are adding to the spit and mud that Saint Veronica wiped away that day. According to Sister Marie of St Peter, in her visions Jesus told her that He desired devotion to His Holy Face in reparation for sacrilege and blasphemy, which He described as being like a \"poisoned arrow.\" She wrote The Golden Arrow Holy Face Devotion (Prayer) which she said was dictated to her by Jesus. This prayer is now a well known Act of Reparation to Jesus Christ.",

        "description": "The spiritual life of St. John Bosco (1815-1888) was deeply marked by the inspiration of the Holy Virgin. Mary appeared to him in a dream as a child and then in actual visions. St. John Bosco was born in Castelnuovo d'Asti (now Castelnuovo Don Bosco), from a poor family. His father died when he was only two years and his mother Margherita raised him with tenderness, teaching him to see God in nature. John studied, but with difficulty, to enter the seminary. He had constantly prayed to God to clear a path for him. In the meantime, He made His way into his heart with a call to help poor children and maladjusted misfits. In 1846, inspired by the mystical visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary, he founded the Congregation of the Salesians of Don Bosco, the Salesian Cooperators and the union, made up of priests and lay collaborators, created not as a religious order, but as an \"association\". The members do not wear the robe of a religious order, but they are organized and operate for one purpose: the education of children and street youth, to develop in them a Christian conscience and discover skills. Don Bosco had pledged before God to make efforts so that the children could go out and ended up in prison, never to return, and the others never enter it. His catechism classes were held behind bars ever followed. Don Bosco wrote: \"As I made them feel the dignity of man, felt a pleasure in the heart and strive to become better people.\" Leaving a visit to the prisons took the final decision: \"I must be the savior of those young people. It must be prevented at all costs that come in there. \" Thus the Salesians were bor . The Organization was approved by the Church in 1874. In 1872 Don Bosco founded with Mary Mazzarello the daughters of Mary, Help of Christians, also known as Salesian Sisters. Francis de Sales, Philip Blacks, Alfonso Liguori and St. Joseph Cafasso were the masters and formed the school spirit. John Bosco had the mystical gifts from God to perform miracles and prophesy, also received the gift of the union of heart and intuition. He left, besides the Salesians, the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Salesian Cooperators and the Shrine of Mary Help of Christians in Valdocco (Turin) and sixty-four houses of Salesians in six nations. He published and wrote a popular series of books \"for the people and the children of Christian people.\" Old age came early and he was rushed from work with ruthless debt obligations. Don Bosco was just forty-seven years old when he died. When someone ask him to list the great works he accomplished, Don Bosco replied: \"I have not done anything, it is Our Lady who has done everything.\" At the center of his life remains a deep mystical union with Mary. His incorrupt body lies in the Basilica of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1929 he was beatified, canonized in 1934. In 1950 he was named the Catholic patron saint of publishing associations and apprentices.",

Thus began the influx of pilgrims and in the woods, just where she had appeared as the Immaculate Conception was erected a wooden chapel. The church, begun in 1861, was never finished. A local artist painted a picture called the Madonna del Bosco, inspired by the descriptions of the three shepherdesses. This painting was a picture of grace that inspired faith and devotion of many.",

        "description": "She appeared to a poor shepherd, Mikolaj Sikatka, in 1850 who promoted her devotion. She foretold of a cholera epidemic and interceded for the healing of many who sought her help. --------- In 1850-52, a period when Poland was partitioned between Russia and Prussia, Mikolay Sikatka often went to pray before a portrait of the Madonna found by Thomas Klossowski (see Leipzig, 1813), in the Marian chapel in the woods. The pastor Mikolay, a very pious man, one day saw the Blessed Virgin Mary before the portrait and she commissioned him to exhort the people to recite the rosary and to contemplate the sufferings and death of the Lord. In a second appearance, she reconfirmed the appointment and left a special message to the priests, urging them to celebrate and keep in mind the great value of the Mass. On the third appearance the shepherd saw Mary wrapped in a red robe and a white mantle with a precious crown. The Blessed Virgin spoke of conversion and the fate of Poland, the rebirth of the nation, but the first that a war would happen and an epidemic with millions of victims. Then the Virgin disappeared with these words: \"The peoples of the world will marvel when their hopes for peace depend on Poland.\" The shepherd seer had to suffer much when he informed the authorities, and he was even arrested and tortured in prison. However, when cholera spread and claimed many victims, the messages and apparitions that the pastor had reported, were carefully screened by the ecclesiastical authorities and declared true. In September 1852, the special commission had carried the miraculous painting of Lichen in the church, the procession carrying the portrait of the Madonna in the church was attended by more than eighty thousand faithful. Some years later, to accomodate the great movement of Marian devotion (worship was carried out in penance and was characterized by a national spirit), a shrine was erected, where the miraculous painting of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God was transferred to. The seer died in 1857, his body was found incorrupt even forty years later. The September 15, 1967, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, who when he was still a student when he received the grace of a miraculous cure before the picture of Our Lady, celebrated the coronation portrait of the Blessed Virgin Mary in front of one hundred and fifty thousand pilgrims.",

Let us pray Protest (prayer of preparation for death).\" And finally: \"Help me to mourn.\" - Why are you crying?, Veronica asks. -I cry for sinners. See how it rains? Sinners are more numerous than the drops of rain. My Son has the hands and feet nailed, the Five Wounds open. If sinners are not converted, my son will have to allow the end of the world. And you will be content to live three or four months, or you reach the end of the world? - I would rather die! \"Asked Mrs. pray:\" Every day seven Our Fathers, Hail Marys and Glorias by Gore five Our Fathers, Hail Marys and Glorias by the Five wounds and seven Our Fathers, Hail Marys and Glorias for me that my name Our Lady of Sorrows. \" While reciting the prayers requested by the Virgin, Veronica hears a voice: \"Veronica, along with your mother go to the bishop and tell him that a chapel should be built.\" \"But I don't even believe!\" \"Go, tell him, and you will believe.\" Veronica and her mother went to convince Mons. Barzellotti, bishop of Pitigliano, that the story is worthy of interest. On July 20, 1853, he notified Pius IX. On the following August 13, the Pope requested that an investigation be opened and that a chapel be built if the findings were positive. Mons. Barzellotti took ill and died in 1861. The bishop of the diocese of Acquapendente (†1877) spearheaded the investigation. Veronica was deposed by a jury. Meanwhile, she became a third order Franciscan. There was evidence of some healing, such as Veronica's mother, who had a diagnosis of a tumor. On September 8th, 1864, they began to open a church at the location of the apparition for the faithful. It became a parish church. The circumstances delayed the judgment of the ecclesiastical commission. On March 25, 1978, Mons. D'Ascenzi, bishop of Sovano-Pitigliano, published the decree that elevated the sanctuary of Cerreto to the level of Diocesan sanctuary. |Source: Laurentin, Rene and Sbalchiero, Patrick.

        "description": "<p>MAURIAC (France, Auvergne, Cantal) &#160;<br /> La ville de Mauriac est l'une des plus anciennes cités du Cantal. Il existait déjà une implantation de population , dès l'age de bronze. Il est probable que la ville qui existait déjà au début de l'ère chrétienne.[1] <br /> Mais c'est au VIe siècle, prés du monastère bénédictin Saint-Pierre et de la Chapelle Notre-Dame des miracles, fondés par Théodechilde fille de Clovis (à qui la Vierge Marie était apparue, prenant la place d’une cérémonie païenne [2]) que Mauriac prend son essor. La cité devient un grand centre de pèlerinage dédiés à la Vierge, autour de la Chapelle et du premier monastère, reconstruit plusieurs fois au cours des siècles. Ces pèlerinages déplacent des foules considérables. Située à l'emplacement de la chapelle du VI° siècle crée par Théodechilde, la basilique Notre Dame des miracle a été mise en chantier à la fin du XIe siècle. Des documents d'archive précisent, en 1105, que les travaux sont en pleine évolution. Seule basilique dans le Cantal depuis 1921, elle est reconnue comme l'église romane la plus importante de Haute-Auvergne et mérite une longue visite. [1] Le 13 mai 1855, la Vierge a été couronnée et parée d’un diadème d’or et de pierreries offert par Pie IX. Actuellement, un pèlerinage régional rassemble des fidèles le dimanche qui suit le 8 mai.

Just like a mother with her ??child. It was a surprise to all Porzus / Por?inj. After nearly two centuries, when around the Friuli no more remembered those appearances - but he remembered the families of the place, handing down the memory from generation to generation, and gathering together daily in the \"sinkhole \"to pray the Rosary in the open air until the good Grimaz together with the villagers and expense not built it on their heads that chapel -, here is a group of priests, headed mons.Vito Ferini, resumed pilgrimages. Now, as in support of their efforts, it is checked from oblivion a letter, the one that had Grimaz then addressed the priests asking for forgiveness (!) for having built without their permission that chapel. It is a manuscript of 64 pages, in which on testimony also the brother of Teresina, then seventeen, recounts details that are fully in line with what was passed down orally. This has occurred to me on Sunday 1st May when, arriving in the \"sinkhole\", I found myself in the midst of a multitude of faithful gathered, and with Brazilian Sisters of Providence, the celebration of the new year of pilgrimages and the procession with the statue of the \"Madone de Sesule\" and the little Teresa at her feet. Starting from the Chapel of the Apparitions, the march is directed to the church where the Madonna had imprinted on the hand of the seer that all gold cross, which accompanied him until his death, a visible sign of the authenticity of the apparitions. With great joy we hear the voice of Don Vittorino Ghenda, you spend so much for the sanctuary , the good news of the diocesan commission, established by Archbishop Andrea Track Mazzocato for the study of the truth of the apparitions, sure that it will give new impetus to what Heaven wanted to start, repeating to us the recommendation made ??by the Virgin in Teresina: \"Dí his mother and all to sanctify Sundays and holidays, but especially not to blaspheme, which gravely offends God, and observe the fasts prescribed by the Church.\" It is right to think. Who knows what Madonna would not do well here, as already in Lourdes, when finally we wake ourselves in all the surrounding countries, near and far, in imitation of the good people of Porzus / Por?inj, appreciating the great gift that the Virgin still there It offers to present and eternal salvation.

At all events, Our Blessed Lady appears to have special designs over him, since he is her chosen instrument for propagating devotion to her as Queen of Angels, being Director of the Arch-Confraternity. For thirty years, M. Marie Frederic de Bray had been the victim of a very serious malady, which, during the last two of these thirty years, had been complicated with three others of an equally mortal character. All means, ordinary and extraordinary, had been tried. The most eminent physicians of Paris, Montpellier, Turin, and Florence had been consulted: science had declared itself powerless, and God himself seemed deaf to prayers. His Eminence the Cardinal of Clermont Tonnerre, Archbishop of Toulouse, and several relatives of M. de Bray, all persons ot distinguished rank in the world, had entreated the holy Prince Hohenlohe to pray for him, but the prayers of the German thaumaturgus were without any apparent result. There was no hope—death seemed inevitable. M. de Bray was nevertheless only thirty-six years of age. He was very pious, and had immense devotion to the Blessed Virgin. One day he heard the voice of this divine Mother, who said to him, \"Make a vow to go on a pilgrimage to Our Lady of Angels at Assisi, and I will cure thee.\" Some days after this, the physicians declared that at eight o'clock in the evening he would be no more. \"He has no pulse; his agony is nearly over; he will pass away imperceptibly,\" said they to the peasants who had come from the village to make inquiries. (It was the 22nd of July, 1856.) Just as the great clock of the Chateau de Bellevue (belonging to the De Bray family) struck twelve at midnight, and as the dying man was breathing his last sigh, he suddenly gathered up the little strength left, and said with his failing voice to Our Lady, who was present, assisting him, \" I make my vow.\" At that instant he was cured. \"I am cured,\" he cried out, and, to the astonishment of his mother and relations, he rose up, in fact, radically cured. The next day Dr. Portes, a physician who had attended him for thirty years, and who fully expected to find him dead, exclaimed upon seeing him and stirring,\" This is a real miracle.\" And so it was, and well worthy of the power and goodness of Mary.

After the death of her parents she was adopted by an uncle and went to live in Egypt. At the age of thirteen years she was betrothed. The night before the wedding day, she heard the voice of Jesus come from the depths of her heart that whispered these words clearly: \"All things pass. If you give me your heart, I will always be with you. \" After receiving this message, the small Arab wished to remain forever the mystical bride of the Redeemer and did not want to get married. Since then she was treated like a slave, and suffered all kinds of abuse. She was a daughter of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, and when she had the courage to say this was nearly slaughtered by her brother, with whom she had sought refuge. She lay unconscious and was believed dead. The night of the 18th of September 1858, she was thrown into an alley in Alexandria. Mirijam was about to die when a beautiful lady appeared wrapped in a blue dress that woke up, bringing her to life in a miraculous way. When she opened his eyes and saw the Holy Virgin she heard these words: \"Be happy even if you suffer and suffer for God, He sends you only what you need, accept always good.\" After having warned about the temptations of the devil and encouraged to engage in love of neighbor, she prophesied that she would live in a convent in France and would die in the guise of Caramel in Bethlehem. Then she disappeared. All that the Holy Virgin had predicted happened: Mirijam entered the Carmelite Order in 1875 and then founded the Caramel of Bethlehem, where he died August 26, 1878, after living a life full of mystical graces, penance, atonement and suffering . 1997 pp 206-207",

        "description": "<p class=\"IntertitreDeArticle\">Le contexte historique</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">La ville de Gen&egrave;ve est marqu&eacute;e par la R&eacute;forme protestante, et plus pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment par Calvin.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Calvin, apr&egrave;s sa publication de &laquo; l&rsquo;institution chr&eacute;tienne &raquo;, &eacute;tait au premier rang des r&eacute;formateurs. Ses voyages l&rsquo;avaient amen&eacute; &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve o&ugrave; il s&rsquo;impose aux r&eacute;form&eacute;s de France. Il y d&eacute;veloppa une doctrine de la pr&eacute;destination : Dieu non seulement conna&icirc;t le destin de chacun, mais encore il l&rsquo;a d&eacute;cid&eacute; de fa&ccedil;on irr&eacute;vocable. [2]</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Calvin attribue &agrave; Marie une fonction primordiale de formatrice et d&rsquo;enseignante du salut et de la foi. En revanche, le titre &laquo; Marie m&egrave;re de Dieu &raquo; ([titre donn&eacute; au concile d&rsquo;Eph&egrave;se en l&rsquo;an 431 par une &eacute;glise soucieuse de proclamer la v&eacute;rit&eacute; de J&eacute;sus vrai Dieu et vrai homme], est refus&eacute; par Calvin pour des raisons de pol&eacute;mique confessionnelle ou pour des motifs p&eacute;dagogiques. Marie est dite &laquo; M&egrave;re du Fils de Dieu &raquo;. Marie est encore pour Calvin un mod&egrave;le d&rsquo;&eacute;coute, de compr&eacute;hension, de t&eacute;moignage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Saint Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales (1622) montrait que la perfection n&rsquo;est pas le privil&egrave;ge des monast&egrave;res mais que tout chr&eacute;tien peut la r&eacute;aliser. Il conseillait le choix d&rsquo;un bon directeur spirituel, la pratique de l&rsquo;oraison, celle des vertus, particuli&egrave;rement l&rsquo;humilit&eacute; et la douceur.</p>\r\n<p>La ville de Gen&egrave;ve a aussi souffert de la lutte anticl&eacute;ricale du XIX&deg; si&egrave;cle.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Dans ce contexte, l&rsquo;Eglise Notre Dame demeure pendant environ 50 ans la premi&egrave;re &eacute;glise catholique romaine. L&rsquo;&eacute;glise est construite d&egrave;s 1851, sous le vocable de l&rsquo;Immacul&eacute;e Conception, par Mgr Gaspard Mermillod, cur&eacute; de Gen&egrave;ve.</p>\r\n<p class=\"SecondLigneRouge\">Notre-Dame de Gen&egrave;ve : Sous le vocable de l&rsquo;Immacul&eacute;e conception</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Dans le contexte suisse, il est bon de rappeler que l&rsquo;Immacul&eacute;e conception a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;finie pour la premi&egrave;re fois par le concile de B&acirc;le (1431-1449), en Suisse :</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">&laquo; Nous d&eacute;finissons et nous d&eacute;clarons que la doctrine d&rsquo;apr&egrave;s laquelle la glorieuse Vierge Marie, M&egrave;re de Dieu, par un effet sp&eacute;cial de la gr&acirc;ce divine pr&eacute;venante et op&eacute;rante, n&rsquo;a jamais &eacute;t&eacute; souill&eacute;e du p&eacute;ch&eacute; originel, mais a toujours &eacute;t&eacute; sainte et immacul&eacute;e, est une doctrine pieuse, conforme au culte de l&rsquo;Eglise, &agrave; la foi catholique, &agrave; la droite raison et &agrave; l&rsquo;Ecriture sainte ; qu&rsquo;elle doit &ecirc;tre approuv&eacute;e, conserv&eacute;e et profess&eacute;e par tous les catholiques. &raquo; (Mansi , 29, 182 sq).</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Le dogme de &laquo; l&rsquo;Immacul&eacute;e Conception &raquo; fut promulgu&eacute; en 1854 et r&eacute;exprim&eacute; par Vatican II. La saintet&eacute; de la m&egrave;re de J&eacute;sus. Cette saintet&eacute; est &agrave; la fois le fruit de la R&eacute;demption (par le Christ) et le fruit de la longue histoire du salut v&eacute;cue librement par le peuple de l&rsquo;Ancien Testament. A cela s&rsquo;ajoute l&rsquo;enti&egrave;re fid&eacute;lit&eacute; de Marie &agrave; l&rsquo;Esprit Saint qui la sanctifie.\r\n<link />On pourra relire &agrave; ce qu'a dit Vatican II a ce sujet.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"SecondLigneGrisSans\">La statue de Notre-Dame de Gen&egrave;ve : une histoire tr&egrave;s belle, tr&egrave;s &eacute;mouvante [1]</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">C'&eacute;tait en novembre 1859, l'abb&eacute; Mermillod arrivait &agrave; Rome pour pr&ecirc;cher la station de l'Avent &agrave; St-Louis des Fran&ccedil;ais.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Pie IX lui accorda une audience. L'entretien fut des plus intimes. Le jeune pr&ecirc;tre offrit au Saint-P&egrave;re une belle photographie de l'&eacute;glise de Notre-Dame. Pie IX, vouant l'&eacute;difice encore sans clocher, sans fl&egrave;che, dit : &laquo; Il y manque quelque chose, une main qui montre le ciel aux habitants de Gen&egrave;ve. &raquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Avant de quitter Rome, l&rsquo;abb&eacute; sollicita une derni&egrave;re audience du Souverain Pontife. Elle lui fut accord&eacute;e.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">L'abb&eacute; Mermillod trouva le Pape dans une grande tristesse. Ses ennemis ourdissaient contre lui les plus noirs complots. Il en fit part au jeune pr&ecirc;tre.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Dans sa grande tristesse, Pie IX n'oubliait pas Gen&egrave;ve. Il en vint &agrave; sa promesse de la premi&egrave;re audience. &laquo; J'ai trouv&eacute; ce qu'il faut pour Notre-Dame, dit-il. Je poss&egrave;de dans ma biblioth&egrave;que particuli&egrave;re une statue de la Sainte Vierge, devant laquelle je prie chaque jour, depuis la promulgation du dogme de l'Immacul&eacute;e Conception. J'y tiens beaucoup, cependant, par elle je veux prendre possession de Gen&egrave;ve. &raquo;</p>\r\n<p>Emu comme on le devine, l'abb&eacute; Mermillod remercia, puis se permit d'ajouter :</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">&laquo; Tr&egrave;s Saint-P&egrave;re, encore une faveur, je vous en prie, daignez la b&eacute;nir. &raquo;</p>\r\n<p>&laquo; Oh ! fit Pie IX, je l'ai b&eacute;nie bien souvent et elle m'a tant de fois b&eacute;ni moi-m&ecirc;me. &raquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">La statue est une oeuvre d'art sortie des ateliers de Forzani, un des meilleurs sculpteurs de ce temps.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Le 5 f&eacute;vrier 1860, dans l'&eacute;glise de Notre-Dame, avait lieu l'inauguration de la statue. Une foule compacte se pressait dans la vaste enceinte. M. l'abb&eacute; Mermillod monta en chaire, et commen&ccedil;a ainsi :</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">&laquo; Abraham, p&egrave;re des croyants, c'est la figure du Pape, d&eacute;fenseur des plus pr&eacute;cieux dons de l'&acirc;me, la foi et la libert&eacute; de croire en J&eacute;sus-Christ. Sara figure la Sainte Vierge, devenue ici, par le temple que les catholiques lui ont &eacute;rig&eacute; : NOTRE-DAME DE GEN&Egrave;VE. Si l'Immacul&eacute;e Conception a &eacute;t&eacute; proclam&eacute;e avec plus de solennit&eacute; que dans les temps ant&eacute;rieurs, c'est pour rendre un hommage plus &eacute;clatant &agrave; la divinit&eacute; de J&eacute;sus-Christ. &raquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Mais quand l'&eacute;glise de Notre-Dame fut arrach&eacute;e aux catholiques, que devint la statue v&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;e? &hellip; la catacombe de la rue de Monthoux et ailleurs... Et ceci pendant 17 ans.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"SecondLigneGrisSans\">Le couronnement de Notre Dame [1]</p>\r\n<p>On se pr&eacute;occupa de la couronne &agrave; d&eacute;poser sur le front de la Vierge tant aim&eacute;e.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">M. l'abb&eacute; Lachenal, qui conna&icirc;t bien la charit&eacute; de ses ouailles, leur adressa un appel tr&egrave;s discret, tr&egrave;s d&eacute;licat et bient&ocirc;t l'or, les bijoux, les broches, les sautoirs, les boucles d'oreilles, les anneaux, les perles pr&eacute;cieuses tomb&egrave;rent abondantes dans la main du bon Pasteur.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Un grand artiste genevois, M. Feuillat, fut charg&eacute; de r&eacute;aliser le travail de la riche couronne. Il y mit tout son talent et il r&eacute;ussit &agrave; en faire comme un bel ex-voto dans lequel les bijoux sont sertis directement. La couronne est enrichie de quatre &eacute;maux repr&eacute;sentant les aspects de la vie de la Sainte Vierge en liaison symbolique avec l'histoire de Notre-Dame de Gen&egrave;ve. On y voit l'Annonciation, la Visitation, les Douleurs, enfin le couronnement avec le mill&eacute;sime de 1937.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Les quatre arcs qui r&eacute;unissent le bandeau &agrave; la croix du sommet sont enrichis de chrysoprases, de lapis-lazuli et d'agates. Quelques diamants et turquoises d&eacute;corent les ornements qui r&eacute;unissent les plaques d'&eacute;mail. La croix qui surmonte une boule d'or porte au centre un diamant de la plus belle eau.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Cette oeuvre remarquable mesure 33 centim&egrave;tres de hauteur et 22 centim&egrave;tres de largeur.</p>\r\n<p class=\"SecondLigneGrisSans\">Le rang de basilique</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Le Pape Pie XII &eacute;l&egrave;ve au rang de basilique ce lieu de culte situ&eacute; pr&egrave;s de la gare principale. Son emplacement en fait un lieu de passage, de pri&egrave;re et d'accueil tr&egrave;s fr&eacute;quent&eacute;.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"SecondLigneRouge\">A Gen&egrave;ve encore&hellip;</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Ajoutons qu&rsquo;&agrave; Gen&egrave;ve, dans le centre historique, &agrave; l&rsquo;ext&eacute;rieur de l&rsquo;&eacute;glise de Sarzano, on trouve cette statue de Marie avec Jean le Baptiste et J&eacute;sus enfant</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">La proximit&eacute; et la familiarit&eacute; de Jean le Baptiste avec l&rsquo;enfant J&eacute;sus et la Vierge Marie provient du fait que la Vierge enceinte de J&eacute;sus a visit&eacute; sa parente enceinte de Jean, et ce fut l&rsquo;occasion d&rsquo;une b&eacute;n&eacute;diction, d&rsquo;une effusion de joie dans l&rsquo;Esprit Saint.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>________________</p>\r\n<p class=\"noteDeArticle\">[1] http://www.abbaye-saint-benoit.ch/pelerinagessuisses/pelerinagesuisses.</p>\r\n<p class=\"noteDeArticle\">[2] Paul CHRISTOPHE, l&rsquo;Eglise dans l&rsquo;histoire des hommes, tome 2, &eacute;ditions Droguet-Ardent, Limoges 1985, p.86</p>\r\n<p class=\"noteDeArticle\">[3] GROUPE DES DOMBES, Marie, tome I, Bayard, Paris 1997, &sect; 66-67, p.45-46</p>",

Righetto said he saw a beautiful lady who caressed him and recommended to be good. A year earlier, a pious woman who died in the odor of sanctity had said that the Virgin wanted to be honored in that place and to restore the chapel. No one had given importance to the fact until March of 1862 when a young man, John Castellani, the point of death due to tuberculosis was miraculously cured by invoking the Virgin Mary seen by Righetto. On 21 September of that same year, the bishop laid the foundation stone of the Shrine of the Madonna della Stella. Righetto entered as a brother in the Congregation of the Fathers of obedience Somaschi and began his beatification. The apparitions were recognized by the local bishop.

        "description": "BISHOP APPROVED AND VATICAN RECOGNIZED (see the list of Vatican recognized apparitions) Philippsdorf is a village in northern Bohemia, founded in 1681 by Count Philipp of Dietrichstein Siegmund. Magdalene Kade , a woman of thirty-one born in this village, suffered for many years from a series of very serious illnesses. An orphan, she lived with her 34 year old brother Joseph, with his wife Cecilia and their five children. On January 13, 1866 at two in the morning, Mary Magdalene was in bed and could not speak due to extreme weakness. A dear friend watched her. The patient paused to contemplate the portrait of Our Lady of Sorrows on the wall opposite the bed. At four AM, Magdalene suddenly called her friend and said, excitedly, \"Look at that shine! Look at that beauty.\" The friend looked but saw nothing. Magdalene was the only privileged one to see the splendor of a lady dressed in white, with a golden tiara in her hair, close to the bed. Magdalene trembled and knew that she had received a visit of the Blessed Virgin Mary! The Madonna moved her lips silently said, \"My daughter, now you are healed!\" And then she disappeared. The patient was able to quickly get up and find that she was completely healed. A bishop's commission examined the miraculous event and recognized the healing and supernatural character. In the period between 1870 and 1885 a neo-Romanesque church was built and was elevated to minor basilica by Pope Leo XIII, who officially consecrated it and dedicated to Mary, \"Help of Christians.\" This shrine is still an important place of pilgrimage. Meanwhile in 1884 the first stone of the convent of the Redemptorists was laid that the following year, and they took custody of the church and the care of pilgrims. On December 10, 1905, Magdalene Kade died in Gerorgswalde and was given a solemn funeral. She had sold everything to help with expenses of building the church sanctuary. On September 13, 1886, at Kathenhof, a mother sadly wrapped her legs of her child for amputation in the linen cloth that was laid at the feet of Our Lady in Philippsdorf. The child felt a strong sensation of heat and after three days he was completely cured. This child became a missionary priest in the Congregation of Divine Word in the Netherlands. In the same year, the chaplain Father Francis Storch said he recorded eleven sets of miraculous healings and graces received through the intercession of the Virgin Mary venerated at Philippsdorf.",

Elle se sent définitivement guérie.</p> <p>Une enquête est diligentée par le clergé diocésain. La guérison de Maria est authentifiée. L'évêque d'Innsbruck accepte de consacrer une chapelle votive sur le lieu montré par l'apparition au cours du sommeil de la 'voyante'.</p> <p>Le pèlerinage draîne des centaines de visites par mois.

The Mother of God was always adorned with a blue vest and a white coat and silently showed herself to the mystic Catherine. Inspired by these visions, the seer founded an orphanage in 1884 and in 1899 a community of Third Order of St. Dominic, which she led as prioress. Because of disobedience against the bishop of Metz Willibrord Benzler OSB, this community was dissolved. The mystic received the gift of the Holy Stigmata, the supernatural authenticity, however, was questioned. Even Catherine's mystical experiences, which led Pope Leo XIII to promote the cult of the Holy Rosary, were never validated by ecclesiastical commissions. Hierzenberger 1997 p 225",

        "description": "Marie Julie Jahenny (1850-1941) was born in the village of Blain, in the department of Loire in France. At the age of 23 years, was confined to bed because seriously ill, February 22 1873, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to her twice in the same day: the morning at 11 and 15. The Mother of God was dressed in black and was carrying a large white cross. The first appeared in a silent way, the second time he spoke to the Blessed Virgin Mary, consoled her and promised healing, also asked her if she was ready to receive the holy stigmata. Then the Virgin disappeared. From this time began to prime a life of intense atonement for the sins of the world and for the poor souls. She received the holy stigmata, and the grace of many visions and contemplations of the Mother of God, Jesus Christ and the saints. As the Virgin had announced , the visionary recovered on May 2. Suddenly her face flushed, she put on her clothes and prepared to join a meeting with nearly two thousand people who wanted to see her. He wanted to make them witnesses to the promise of Our Lady. On October 7, Marie Julie received the wounds from the crown of thorns, and on November 25 a sore shoulder, where Jesus carried the weight of the Cross, in January of 1874 manifested wrists the marks of the ropes with which Jesus was bound, on February 21 appeared the imprint of the ring on the ring of mystical marriage \" (visible up to 1909). Since 1930 the stigmata disappeared, remaining only partially visible and sometimes bleeding. The seer also had many visions on the future of France, the Church and the world saw terrible revolutions, wars and devastation, but also that France would bloom again and renew the Church. The Church's position before this case was not unique: the Bishop Fournier, responsible for the diocese, knew and believed in the apparitions, the visionary who had had their origin and the mystical. On the death of Fournier, three weeks later, Marie Julie was excommunicated. After examination, the office of the holy Cardinal Rampolla was positively convinced of the sincerity of this mystical woman. The new bishop, however, decided not to recognize the groups in order to not to alienate its adverse clergy. Theologians and church experts, after examining her too, became convinced that the seer was not faking as many suspected. In 1888 Marie Julie was rehabilitated and then returned to the sacraments. The Church's position was very inconsistent in the face of this case: while the Bishop Le Fer de la Motte (1914-1955) was full of kindness towards the mystic, took care of the contacts, visited her and begged her to ask her prayers and the sin offering for the diocesan clergy; his successor, however, paid no attention to the seer. Almost all the ecstasies and contemplations of Marie Julie were noted, for many years in thousands of pages by Charbonnier and other brothers. Much has been lost in recent years of the seer, especially with the death of all family members, after having cared for over the last year when the mystic died. In 1972 he tried to retrieve all records that remained and were later published. Among the many messages that Marie Julie has left us, they are marked by her expiatory suffering for the confirmation of the secrets of La Salette and Fatima. Father Pius expressed himself thus on Marie Julie: \"She lives like a purple shadow, the better to shine the light of Truth.\"",

This event so rich in supernatural phenomena is also connected by a miraculous healing from possession: that of Barbara Eder. The apparitions were manifested in the period between December 1 through 21, 1876 and again, one last time, Mary appeared in 1878. The main visionaries, Caroline Kraus, Francis Xavier Kraus, Teresa Liebl Sack and Matilda, were all aged between eight and fourteen years, and some adults should be added to the group who saw part of some aspects of the apparitions. The boys had the privilege of receiving the apparitions of the Virgin, the Child Jesus, and sometimes also of St. Joseph and several rows of angels and saints, as well as to see light phenomena. These events were detailed protocolled by the parish priest and the competent bishop, Ignatius Senestrey of Regensburg. The latter, however, immediately distanced himself from the apparitions and was from the beginning decided to suspend the investigation. Contrary to its decisions, several professors, priests and monks of the monastery of Metten protested in Rome. Thus was opened a new investigation. It was hoped in ecclesiastical recognition when the twenty year old Barbara Eder, who suffered from severe forms of possession, was miraculously cured by bathing in the spring of the forest, where they had manifested the phenomena considered supernatural. Despite this alleged extraordinary healing, the bishop refused further investigation. With the death of Father Francis Nock and his father Ugo Dieringer, both monks of the monastery of Metten in favor of opening the investigation ecclesiastical dissolved any hope of a possible recognition and vanished the possibility of building a memorial chapel in the woods.

Our Lady appeared to the visionaries in different ways: sometimes sitting and surrounded by angels, her face radiant in a bright cloud, some other time with a crown on her head and the Child Jesus in her arms. Very little is known of the nature of the messages. But we know that the main message of her appearances was this: \"I want you to recite the rosary every day.\" Following the news of the apparitions developed a remarkable pilgrimage, encouraged by the local parish priest. Most of the pilgrims arrived in that place (then part of the Prussian territory) from Poland. The miraculous case was examined by the competent Ordinariate of Frauensburg who gave an unfavorable opinion to the recognition of the apparitions. On the centenary of the phenomena, however, Cardinal Wojtyla officially recognized the apparitions.",

The Most Holy Mother told to the seer, \"What is lacking in your crown in heaven you have to complete with expiatory suffering ... You must contribute to the heavenly plan, because if humanity does not convert I can not stop the hand of my Son who has already been too patient. \" Our Lady appeared 18 more times until September 22, 1883, in her parents' house in Via Bonnet and the convent of the Sisters of the Sacred Heart of the Grandis where, in 1891 after being miraculously cured from tuberculosis, she came to embrace the religious life. On January 2, 1883 Our Lady appeared and asked her to ensure that a medal of \"Mother of Solitude\" was created and disseminated.

But when Marie came back into the room, Therese did not recognize her, for she was in the midst of the worst attack of her whole illness. Marie later testified how she wanted to give Therese something to drink, but Therese screamed in terror: 'They want to poison me.\" Everyone was quite distraught at this sudden downturn. After some futile attempts to show Therese that she was by her side, Marie knelt by the bed with her sisters Celine and Leonie, and began praying fervently before the statue they later called the \"Virgin of the Smile.\" Therese also turned towards the statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Suddenly Marie saw Therese's face grow calm and her eyes clear. They all realized that something extraordinary was happening. We shall let Therese herself describe what happened next: \"All of a sudden the Blessed Virgin appeared beautiful to me, so beautiful that never had I seen anything so attractive; her face was suffused with an ineffable benevolence and tenderness, but what penetrated to the very depths of my soul was the ravishing smile of the Blessed Virgin.\" \"At that instant, all my pain disappeared, and two large tears glistened on my eyelashes, and flowed down my cheeks silently, but they were tears of complete joy. Oh! I thought, the Blessed Virgin smiled at me, how happy I am, but I will never tell anyone, for my happiness would then disappear. \"Without any effort I lowered my eyes, and I saw Marie who was looking at me lovingly; she seemed moved and appeared to know the favor the Blessed Virgin had given me. Oh! it was really to her--to her touching prayers that I owed the grace of the Queen of heaven’s smile. Seeing my gaze once again fixed on the Blessed Virgin, she cried out:“Thérèse is cured!”",

She was confused and frightened, and began to run away from the place. The voice called again, and this time Karmela realised that the voice was coming from within the chapel, she went inside and said her usual prayers. The voice which had come from the image of the Blessed Virgin asked her to recite three Ave Maria in honor of the three days Her body remained in the tomb before Assumption to Heaven. Karmela did as the voice asked and went on her way. Shortly afterwards Karmela fell ill and remained confined to her bed for more than a year. After this time, Karmela revealed her secret to a friend, Francesco Portelli, who in turn told her that about the same time he also heard a woman's voice asking him to pray from within the chapel. Shortly after this mysterious call Francesco's mother was miraculously healed by the intercession of Our Lady of Ta` Pinu. The lonely chapel became a place of pilgrimage for many people on the island and beyond. Bishop Pietru Pace was informed about these events and after speaking to Karmela and Francesco he concluded that the voice was of heavenly origins. Devotion to Our Lady of Ta` Pinu grew rapidly, and numerous pilgrimages flocked to the chapel.",

Le 16 mai 1888, un prêtre allègue une apparition du Christ en sang avec sa Mère. Des guérisons sont constatées, dont celle d’un enfant muet de naissance. Des milliers de personnes se rendent sur place. Le clergé diocésain est partagé. Mgr Palmieri alerte Léon XIII et crée une commission d’enquête. Le 23 février 1889, il déclare : « J’ai vécu une apparition de la Vierge. Elle m’est apparue sous l’aspect de Notre-Dame des Douleurs. » Le prélat désire faire bâtir une chapelle au « lieu saint » des apparitions. Le 28 septembre 1890, il pose la première pierre du sanctuaire, assisté des évêques d’Isernia, Trivento et Termoli, en présence de 30 000 fidèles.

Mary appeared repeatedly in a swamp because of the sins of men. The first appearance Jacques saw a large lizard walking on the ground, while watching curiously, then appeared Mary who ordered him to kill it. When the seer, in obedience to the Virgin, he threw a stone at the beast, and he saw it come out a tongue of fire with a sickening stench. Then the Blessed Virgin in a robe white as snow, hovered above the dead animal. Other times, the Madonna appeared weeping and lamenting the sins of men, announcing the coming of divine punishment. At that time she produced many miraculous events, as if to attest to the apparitions of Mary. The church authorities did not set off any canonical investigation.",

Suddenly, more quickly indeed than usual, I felt a piercing sorrow for my sins; but so intense that I have never since experienced the like again. The sorrow was so great that I thought I must die. After that I felt all the powers of my soul in recollection. My intellect knew nothing except my sins and offences against God; my memory recalled each one, and made me see all the torments Jesus had endured to save me. My will moved me to detest them and be willing to suffer anything in expiation. A world of thoughts surged through my mind; thoughts of sorrow, love, fear, hope and encouragement. \"This was quickly followed by a rapture, and I found myself in the presence of my heavenly Mother, with my guardian angel on her right. He commanded me to make an act of contrition, and when I had done so my Mom said to me: 'Daughter, in the name of Jesus I forgive you all your sins,' and added, 'Jesus, my Son, loves you very much, and wishes to give you a grace. Would you know how to become worthy of it?' In my misery I knew not what to answer. Then She continued: 'I will be a mother to you; will you show yourself a true daughter?' And after saying this She opened her mantle and covered me with it. At that instant Jesus appeared with all His wounds open; but blood no longer issued from those wounds, but flames of fire. In an instant those flames came and touched my hands, feet and heart. I felt I was dying and should have fallen had not my Mom held me up, I remaining all the while covered with her mantle, and thus I remained for several hours. Afterwards my Mom kissed me on the forehead, then everything vanished and I found myself kneeling on the ground, but still feeling intense pain in my hands, feet and heart. I got up to go to bed and saw blood flowing from those places where I felt the pain. I covered them up as best I could and then, with the help of my guardian angel, got into bed.\" [From the \"Autobiography of St Gemma Galgani\"]",

        "description": "<p>Depuis 1451, la cathédrale de Cambrai présente à la dévotion des fidèles une image de la Vierge à l’enfant, dite Notre-Dame de Grâce. Ce petit tableau du XIVe siècle, probablement d’origine dalmate, appartient au thème iconographique de la «&#160;Vierge de tendresse&#160;» dont on faisait remonter l’origine à l’évangéliste Luc. Cette attribution lui valut une renommée considérable, d’autant mieux accueillie que sa représentation correspondait à la tendance humanisante des artistes flamands du temps. Malgré la destruction de la cathédrale gothique et les désastres révolutionnaires, l’image, préservée, continua à être l’objet d’une grande dévotion qui aboutit à son couronnement en 1894.</p> <p>En juillet 1905, les Annales du sanctuaire de Notre-Dame de Grâce publièrent les souvenirs de Mgr Delannoy, évêque d’Aire et Dax, qui, octogénaire, avait voulu revoir Cambrai où il avait fait ses études cléricales. Au cours d’un voyage à Rome, il avait été frappé par la multiplicité des Madones proches de celles de Cambrai, au sujet de laquelle il conta une «&#160;anecdote&#160;». Il tenait d’un religieux qui avait montré à Bernadette de Lourdes un recueil d’images de Marie espérant qu’elle y trouverait une ressemblance avec la Vierge des apparitions. Bernadette s’était arrêtée, émue, devant une représentation de la Vierge cambrésienne en disant&#160;: «&#160;Voilà ce que je trouve de plus ressemblant&#160;». À l’époque, cette information n’eut guère d’échos. Mais, en 1974, André Malraux publia , ouvrage dans lequel il rapporte des conversations avec Picasso relatives à la représentation du sacré. Malraux ayant fait allusion à la réaction de Bernadette, Picasso voulut en savoir davantage. La recherche n’aboutit pas et l’abbé Laurentin mit un point final à la discussion.</p> <p class=\"noteDeArticle\">Félicien Machelart, Université de Valenciennes</p>",

Catholique depuis son origine, remontant à saint Pierre lui-même, elle est toujours restée en communion avec le Pape. Riche de ses rites, de sa tradition, de sa langue syriaque (araméenne chrétienne), et de son histoire, elle demeure fortement attachée à la terre du Liban où elle s’est développée.</p>",

Intrigués par la répétition du phénomène, ils les suivirent du regard. Une colombe se dirigea vers le bas de la vallée, tandis que l’autre vint se poser au lieu même de la chapelle actuelle. Dans leur ingénuité et la spontanéité de leur foi, nos bergers furent convaincus que, par ce signe, la Vierge Marie manifestait sa volonté de voir élever en ce lieu <link />une chapelle en son honneur.</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">Les pasteurs se font bâtisseurs et nos bergers érigent un sanctuaire de leur cru. Mais, où trouver une statue de la Mère de Dieu ? De nuit, mais par pure dévotion, ils allèrent dérober la statue de Notre Dame de Pinède ( des Pins ) honorée dans la chapelle de Pinède, en Aragon, de l’autre côté de la frontière.</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">Sur le chemin du retour, la fatigue aidant, ils bivouaquent près du Port de Canaou, ne surveillant que d’un œil leur précieux butin. Dès que les propriétaires légitimes découvrent la rapine, ils se mettent en chasse et viennent récupérer leur madone, tout en respectant le sommeil des ravisseurs.</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">À leur réveil, la déception de nos bergers est grande. Mais, elle est quelque peu atténuée par la découverte d’une belle source au-dessous du rocher sur lequel ils avaient posé la statue. Ils cherchent et découvrent une remplaçante aussi belle que la Vierge Marie aragonaise. Elle sera celle de leur chapelle et la source deviendra la Fontaine Notre Dame.</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">&#160;</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">La trace la plus ancienne de l’existence du sanctuaire est de 1349. Plus tard, un petit prieuré de quelques chapelains est fondé et une nouvelle chapelle est construite. Des pèlerinages s’organisent depuis les vallées de Gavarnie, de Luz et de Barèges.</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">&#160;</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">Nous sommes en haute montagne. Régulièrement, les intempéries et les avalanches provoquent de gros dégâts au sanctuaire. En janvier 1915, une grosse avalanche anéantit la chapelle qu’il faut reconstruire. La chapelle actuelle a été bénite le 12 août 1928.</p> <p> <link article=\"59\" />Site officiel.</p>",

Nous ignorons ce que cette oeuvre est devenue au fil du temps.</p> <p>En voici l'histoire comme la raconte une source traditionnelle : au XIV<sup>e</sup> siècle, deux bergers virent deux colombes blanches se poser près d'eux, à proximité d'une fontaine. L'une d'elle se dirigea dans la vallée, l'autre se posa sur le lieu de la chapelle actuelle.</p> <p>Intrigués, les deux bergers prirent la décision de faire construire un petit sanctuaire en l'honneur de la Vierge à cet endroit. Mais ils ne surent quelle statue de Marie installer à l'intérieur. Aussi se rendirent-ils en Aragon, de l'autre côté de la frontière espagnole, jusqu'à la chapelle de Pinède, pour dérober en pleine nuit la statue vénérée par les pèlerins du coin.&#160;</p> <p>Au retour, pris de fatigue, ils firent une halte près du Port de Canaou. Ils s'assoupirent.

En revanche, ils poussèrent un cri de surprise : la statue aragonaise avait disparu !

A cette date existait un oratoire, remplacé un peu plus tard par un petit prieuré desservi par des chapelains.&#160;</p> <p>La chapelle a subi les outrages du temps. En 1915, une avalanche l'a complètement ravagée. Un nouvel édifice a été béni le 12 août 1928 en présence de nombreux fidèles et prêtres.&#160; &#160;</p>",

Elle a recueilli plusieurs messages \"célestes\" demandant paix, prière et conversion des hommes.</p> <p>Lors de la première apparition du décembre 1933, l'abbé Karl Benz, accompagnateur spirituel de madame Rauchle, constata que celle-ci était plongée dans une \"forte extase\". Il la ramena à elle en la faisant \"sortir de ce profond ravissement\".</p> <p>Le lendemain (8 décembre 1933), la 'voyante' observa \"trois rayons de lumière\" sortir de la poitrine de l'apparition.</p> <p>En mars 1934, madame Rauchle s'inquiéta : les gens parlent entre eux et certains doutent de ses expériences. \"Montre-toi donc à d'autres personnes, sinon on dira que je suis folle\", lança-t-elle à Marie. Ce jour-là, la Vierge l'invita à une date précise à la maison Saint-Martin, devenue depuis lors une réplique de la grotte de Lourdes.</p> <p>En juin 1934, Marie se montra \"entourée de nuées grises\". Le 24 juin 1934, un message donna de l'espoir à tous : \"Je protégerai l'Allemagne\".</p> <p>Mgr Johannes Baptista Sproll, évêque de Rottenburg, nomma une commission d'enquête officielle. En attendant les résultats, il fit interdire l'accès au lieu des apparitions. Mais le 24 août 1938, les nazis éliminèrent le prélat, opposant au régime hitlérien, et l'investigation fut aussitôt arrêtée. Elle n'a jamais été reprise.</p>",

Le message qu’elle lui a laissé est toujours d’actualité.</p> <p>Chaque année, des centaines de milliers de pèlerins, viennent,seuls ou en groupe, confier à Notre Dame leurs pauvretés, leurs souffrances, leurs peines, leurs recherches. Ils viennent se confier à la Mère du Sauveur, et dire leur confiance et leur espérance en Celui qui est la Source de toute grâce, Jésus-Christ.</p> <p>Aujourd’hui encore, comme elle l’a fait pour Mariette, la Vierge des Pauvres conduit chaque pèlerin de Banneux sur la route de l’existence. Elle l’invite à pousser les mains dans l’eau de la Source, pour puiser en Jésus la vraie Vie.</p>",

Puis son \"<em>ange gardien</em>\" passa près d'elle ; elle sentit une \"<em>guérison complète</em>\" en son corps.</p> <p>En 1930, Luigina est admise chez les Filles de Saint-Paul de don Alberione et, l'année suivante, une longue et pénétrante vision de sainte Rita la plongea dans un ravissement durable.</p> <p>En 1937, tandis qu'elle visitait l'église romaine de Trois-Fontaines (<em>Tre Fontane</em>), dix ans avant l'apparition mariale à Bruno Cornacchiola, Notre-Dame se montra à elle. Les mois suivants elle reçut la visite mystérieuse de sainte Thérèse de Lisieux, sainte Gemma Galgani, du futur saint Padre Pio. Elle a rencontré Pie XII lors d'une audience publique en 1954.</p>",

Situé en Lozère (diocèse de Mende) fut pourtant le théâtre d'apparitions mariales entre décembre 1937 et février 1938.&#160;</p> <p>A cette époque, au lieu-dit 'roc du Colombier', Henriette Dejean, 15 ans, enfant de l'assistance publique, croyante, affirme voir la Vierge Marie à \"<em>un mètre d'elle, debout sur un rocher, avec des yeux bleus, des cheveux blonds, vêtue d'un long voile blanc, portant une couronne d'or sur laquelle brille une petite croix.</em>\"&#160;</p> <p>Selon Henriette, l'apparition n'est pas une image cinématographique ou télévisuelle, mais bien une personne : \"<em>elle est vivante</em>\", commente-t-elle.&#160;</p> <p>Henriette informe l'abbé Paul Morin, curé de sa paroisse, au sujet de ces manifestations. Après avoir longuement intérrogé l'adolescente, il lui déclare : \"<em>Tu ne risques rien.</em>\"</p> <p>Des messages sont recueillis. L'apparition demande la construction d'une chapelle, la conversion des français (\"<em>Je viens pour sauver la France</em>\"), la paix entre les hommes. Elle décline son identité après plusieurs jours seulement : \"<em>Je suis la Vierge immaculée\"</em>.&#160;</p> <p>En revanche, comme à Kerizinen (Finistère) par exemple, des prophéties annoncées ne sont pas réalisées : jaillissement d'une source d'eau sur un rocher, guérisons inexpliquées... C'est l'élément 'troublant' du dossier. Certains médecins, appelés au chevet d'henriette, trouvent cette dernière dans un \"<em>état hynoptique</em>\" grave.</p> <p>Mais les fruits spirituels, bien que limités, sont assez positifs : amorce d'un pèlerinage local, lecture de la Bible, groupes de prière, etc. L'évêque de Mende n'a pas nommé de commission d'enquête ni, d'ailleurs, pris aucune décisqion à l'encontre d'Henriette.

        "description": "<p>Il y a 52 ans, 1938-1990, j’étais témoin des débuts du culte public rendu à Notre-Dame de Bonheur en l’église d’Ollioules, près Toulon, dans le Var. Je tiens à verser mon témoignage pour l’histoire de&#160;ce sanctuaire.&#160; <b>Le témoignage du vicaire général du diocèse de Fréjus-Toulon:</b> J’étais alors séminariste à la Castille. Le 31 Mars 1938, nous fêtions le jubilé d’or sacerdotal de notre Evêque, Mgr Simeone. C’est après le repas, que le curé doyen d’Ollioules, l’Abbé Auguste Rauzi qui venait d’être nommé Chanoine, au moment du toast, prit la parole pour nous présenter N.D. de Bonheur. C’était la première fois que nous entendions ce nom.</p> <blockquote>« Notre Dame de Bonheur c’est Notre Dame des prêtres. En ce jubilé sacerdotal, nous jubilons d’être prêtres. Vous séminaristes, vous connaîtrez le bonheur d’être prêtres. C’est N.D. de Bonheur qui vous conservera dans la joie ». </blockquote> <p>Ce qui est frappant, en rapprochant les dates, c’est la rapidité avec laquelle le culte de N.D. de Bonheur, fut officialisé ; en 12 jours de préparation : -19 Mars 1938, visite de Mme Joly à Ollioules ; -25 Mars : invocation à N.D. de Bonheur approuvée par l’évêque ; -31 Mars : Mgr Simeone annonce une prochaine reconnaissance du culte public; - 23 Avril : proclamation du vocable lors d’une messe solennelle à Ollioules avec homélie du Chanoine Llosa, Archiprêtre de Toulon qui allait être nommé, trois mois après, Evêque d’Ajaccio. Ainsi, en 35 jours seulement, le culte public de N.D. de Bonheur&#160;venait d'être rendu publique&#160;dans notre diocèse. Il fallut pour ce résultat des hommes et des circonstances. (cf « Semaine Religieuse » n° 15 – 1938 pages 217 – 272 – 758). 1) Il y eut d'abord Edmond Joly, écrivain belge, (1861 – 1932) qui écrivit un ouvrage intitulé : \"N.D. de Bonheur\", destiné dans sa pensée à rester anonyme, mais qui fut publié, à titre posthume, en 1938. Cet ouvrage rencontra l’attention de tout un public: - tout d'abord le Cardinal Mercier, qui apprécia la valeur théologique et poétique de l’ouvrage; - puis le Cardinal Baudrillart, qui&#160;écrivit en liminaire du livre :</p> <blockquote>\"&#160;le livre d’Edmond Joly, « N.D. de Bonheur », se lève comme une étoile à suivre ; il nous enseigne à aimer Marie, comme il convient, à incorporer son culte comme une eau mêlée à une autre eau.\" </blockquote> <p>Un véritable&#160;ressourcement chrétien se fit grâce à l’intervention d’un prêtre varois, Vicaire à la cathédrale de Toulon, l’Abbé Auguste Rauzy(1873 – 1951) – (cf semaine religieuse Toulon 1951) à propos de Notre Dame de Bonheur.. L'abbé Auguste était issu d’une très chrétienne famille provençale qui donna deux prêtres au diocèse : Joseph et Auguste Rauzi. Ce dernier était un esprit féru de musique, d’histoire et d’art. Nommé vicaire à la cathédrale de Toulon, en 1925, il publia une monographie sur cette cathédrale Sainte Marie. Cet ouvrage lu par Edmond Joly, initia des relations artistiques entre les deux hommes. Le Vicaire de la cathédrale sainte Marie de Toulon présenta lui-même l’autel du Corpus et&#160; la statue de N.D. de Bonheur, œuvre magnifique de Puget qui se trouvait alors dans la cathédrale, à l'auteur. C’est dans le souvenir de cette visite que, des années après, Mme Joly,vint à Ollioules retrouver le vicaire devenu curé doyen. La visite mémorable de madame Joly Le 19 Mars 1938, Madame Edmond Joly, conduite par le curé Rauzy visita l’église d’Ollioules, où avait été transportée la fameuse statue. Elle s’arrêta devant&#160;cette statue de la Vierge&#160;par Puget&#160;-qui n’est pas seulement une œuvre d’art, mais un cantique de foi-, et là,&#160;elle demanda :</p> <blockquote>\"Comment s’appelle-t-elle ?\" \"Mais la Vierge Marie !\" \"N’a-t-elle pas un nom particulier ?\" \"Pas que je sache\" . &#160;\"Voulez-vous, M. le Curé, que nous l’appelions Notre-Dame de Bonheur ?&#160;\" \"Madame, si c’est pour la gloire de Marie, ce sera aussi mon plus grand bonheur\" </blockquote> <p>Le Chanoine Rauzy, qui rapporte lui-même la conversation, lors de l’intronisation de N.D. de Bonheur, le 23 Avril 1938, conclut ainsi :</p> <blockquote>\"un joyeux merci s’envola au ciel. Notre-Dame de Bonheur, se trouva personnifiée dans cette splendide statue de Marie. Sans aucun préavis, N.D. de Bonheur, s’est intronisée elle-même dans notre Eglise… Si d’habitude, c’est par Marie que l’on va à Jésus, cette fois, c’est par Jésus que nous avons eu Marie : c’est du Corpus Domini, le tabernacle de la cathédrale que nous est venue N.D. de Bonheur ». </blockquote> <p>Le lien diocésain se trouve d’une étonnante visibilité : la cathédrale est le lieu où les fidèles sont rassemblés auprès de leur Evêque avec tout son presbyterium. N.D. de Bonheur éclaire, comme une étoile, notre Diocèse. (Homélie, en la fête de N.D. de Bonheur, à Ollioules, le 22 Août 1990)</p>",

        "description": "<p>Le 8 septembre 1939, à la déclaration de la guerre, l'abbé Paul Elias confie ses trois paroisses à Notre-Dame et fait le vœu de perpétuer sa protection maternelle en érigeant un monument en son honneur. Le 8 septembre 1946, fête de la Nativité de la sainte Vierge, le vœu ayant été exaucé, une procession de reconnaissance se rend au pied du rocher sur le bord de la Gorre. Le 14 septembre 1947 avait lieu l'inauguration de la Grotte, réplique parfaite de celle de Lourdes, où les pélerins ne cessent de venir. On ne compte plus les faveurs que Notre-Dame accorde à ceux qui viennent la prier en ce lieu. <b>Le pélerinage fut placé sous le vocable de Notre-Dame de la Paix. </b> Il ne s'agit pas d'abord de la paix entre les nations, mais de la paix intérieure qui est un bien précieux entre tous pour chaque personne.</p> <blockquote><i>« La Paix soit avec vous ! » </i></blockquote> <p>Une statue originale de Notre-Dame de la Paix, œuvre du sculpteur Y.Goy, située sur la colline face à la Grotte, domine toute la vallée. Elle est placée à l'aboutissement d'un mur semi-circulaire portant, sur huit blocs de granit, le texte des Béatitudes. L'Enfant-Jésus, dans les bras de sa Mère, tend la main droite vers les textes, semblant dire:</p> <blockquote>« Vivez les Béatitudes, elles sont le sentier de la Paix pour chacun d'entre vous et pour l 'humanité. » </blockquote> <p>On remarque, enfoncé dans le mur, un reliquaire en cuivre contenant de la terre et un caillou provenant du Mont des Béatitudes en Palestine. Des pélerins vénèrent avec respect cette « relique ». <b>Saint-Auvent&#160; est un&#160;petit bourg (dans la Haute Vienne). </b> Avec ses maisons anciennes, ses rues étroites, son église des 12ième-14ième siècles, situé sur un piton rocheux dominant les gorges de la Gorre et du Gorret, présente un intérêt touristique certain. Le domaine de Notre-Dame se trouve à 200 mètres du bourg, au point le plus pittoresque de la rivière, dont le lit est encombré de rochers qui entraînent la formation de nombreux rapides ainsi que plusieurs îles boisées. L'ensemble est fort agréable à voir. Ce qui caractérise le pélerinage, ce sont les nombreuses découvertes, d'une grande valeur culturelle et religieuse, que le promeneur peut faire dans le vaste domaine: &#160;1 - La Grotte, réplique fort réussie de celle de Lourdes, où brûlent sans cesse des cierges. 2 - L'Oratoire de Notre-Dame de la Paix, centre du pélerinage, est situé sur une colline qui domine la vallée. 3 - Au creux du vallon, l'oratoire de Notre-Dame de Pontmain. 4 - Au flanc de la colline, deux statues de Notre-Dame de la Saiette, évoquant les deux positions de l'apparition, le 19 septembre 1846. 5 - La statue de Notre-Dame de Fatima, vénérée par les Portugais. 6 - L'oratoire de la Médaille Miraculeuse, aménagé dans un bois de chênes. 7 - Les sentiers des Mystères Joyeux, Douloureux et Glorieux du Rosaire. Ils constituent les trois nefs du domaine. Une brève évocation des « mystères », gravée sur bois, est échelonnée le long des sentiers. 8 - Le Chemin de Croix. Son parcours, d'environ 700 mètres, dans la colline, fait penser à celui de Lourdes. La figuration des stations, aux couleurs vives, est attrayante, les textes sont brefs et évocateurs. Il y a une 15ième station: la Résurrection; c'est un véritable monument. 9 - La Chapelle Notre-Dame de la Paix: Elle a été bâtie en 1989. Bien insérée dans le site champêtre, elle retient l'attention et charme le regard par sa maçonnerie « à l'ancienne » en mœllons de granit, son toit en chaume, le léger clocheton dominant l'ample auvent. A l'intérieur, on est saisi par l'atmosphère de recueillement qui émane de la pénombre, sous la paille qui sent bon, supportée par une charpente robuste et originale. Une grande beauté se dégage de la recherche du dépouillement et de la pauvreté en toutes choses: l'autel est un vieux coffre en bois, le tabernacle a été creusé dans un tronc de noyer, les sièges sont des tabourets et des bancs avec leur écorce, la séparation entre le sanctuaire et la sacristie est une crèche provenant d’une grange avec les « cornadis » ou « chandelles » portant les chaînes pour attacher le bétail. Dernière réalisation du pélerinage, la chapelle Notre-Dame de la Paix en est l'élément le plus remarquable et le plus attrayant. Tout cet ensemble, dans un site merveilleux, fait du sanctuaire de Notre-Dame de la Paix un pôle d'attraction où viennent environ 20 000 visiteurs par an.</p>",

La population en avait fait le v&oelig;u dans une p&eacute;riode o&ugrave; la peste mena&ccedil;ait gravement la r&eacute;gion. La chapelle fut ensuite reconstruite en 1774 &agrave; l&rsquo;int&eacute;rieur de la Cath&eacute;drale saint Laurent (San Lorenzo). Elle est somptueuse par ses marbres et des bronzes dor&eacute;s. Un retable de 1632 repr&eacute;sente saint Laurent et Roc avec la Vierge &agrave; l&rsquo;enfant, une &oelig;uvre de Giovanni Battista Carloni di Rovio.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Le 19 mai 1940, l&rsquo;&eacute;v&ecirc;que du lieu couronna Notre Dame des gr&acirc;ces et ce fut l&rsquo;occasion de sculpter sur le fronton de la cath&eacute;drale l&rsquo;inscription: &laquo;Honorate Mariam, quae multum laborat pro vobis&raquo;.</p>\r\n<p class=\"petitAdroite\">_____________________</p>\r\n<p class=\"SecondLigneRouge\">Notre Dame de Lorette, &agrave; Lugano</p>\r\n<p>CH 6900 - LUGANO - 091-9942038</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Erig&eacute;e en 1524, l&rsquo;&eacute;glise Santa Maria de Loreto ne fut rendue au culte catholique qu&rsquo;en 1904. Sa fa&ccedil;ade est orn&eacute;e d&rsquo;un portique baroque d&eacute;cor&eacute; de fresques et attenante &agrave; un couvent de Fr&egrave;res franciscains.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">L&rsquo;int&eacute;rieur pr&eacute;sente une chapelle, construite en 1728, copie de la Santa Casa de Loreto (Sainte Maison de Lorette) pr&egrave;s d&rsquo;Ancona en Italie.</p>\r\n<p>L&rsquo;architecte de cette &oelig;uvre est Antonio Somazzi, tandis que la restauration de certaines statues en stuc est de Abbondio Quadri.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Dans le jardin, situ&eacute; devant l&rsquo;&eacute;glise, on trouve une fontaine avec une sculpture en bronze de Saint Fran&ccedil;ois d&rsquo;Assise, &oelig;uvre de Pietro Borsari.</p>\r\n<p>Au XIX&egrave;, l&rsquo;enceinte lat&eacute;rale &eacute;tait le cimeti&egrave;re des chr&eacute;tiens non catholiques.</p>\r\n<p class=\"petitAdroite\">Source : http://www.lugano.ch/fr/cultura</p>\r\n<p class=\"SecondLigneRouge\">Notre Dame de la sant&eacute;, &agrave; Lugano</p>\r\n<p>CH 6900 - LUGANO - MASSAGNO - TEL. 091-9662586</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Au commencement, il n&rsquo;y avait qu&rsquo;une niche avec une fresque de Marie avec l&rsquo;enfant J&eacute;sus et le petit Jean Baptiste. Ce tr&egrave;s humble lieu de pri&egrave;re fut l&rsquo;occasion de tant de gr&acirc;ces et de tant de gu&eacute;risons &ndash; en une &eacute;poque de peste &ndash; que fut construit un oratoire, en 1729. Cet oratoire fut restaur&eacute; en 1975 afin de r&eacute;pandre aujourd&rsquo;hui toujours autant de gr&acirc;ces. [1]</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">N.B. La proximit&eacute; et la familiarit&eacute; de Jean le Baptiste avec l&rsquo;enfant J&eacute;sus et la Vierge Marie provient du fait que la Vierge enceinte de J&eacute;sus a visit&eacute; sa parente enceinte de Jean, et ce fut l&rsquo;occasion d&rsquo;une b&eacute;n&eacute;diction, d&rsquo;une effusion de joie dans l&rsquo;Esprit Saint.

Il arrive à Nagasaki&#160; où il est rejoint par deux frères. L'évêque du lieu, Mgr Janvier Hayasaka, accueille les missionnaires avec bienveillance et autorise la publication d'une revue mariale en japonais, \"le Chevalier de l'Immaculée\". Le père Maximilien se charge d'enseigner la philosophie au séminaire diocésain. Les missionnaires louent une maison auprès de la cathédrale.</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">En 1931, le siège éditorial est transféré du quartier Oura de Nagasaki au <span class=\"orangered\"><strong>faubourg de Hongochi, sur les pentes du Mont Hikosan, où les missionnaires bâtissent un couvent baptisé \"Mugenzai no Sono\" (Jardin de l'Immaculée). Après l'explosion atomique, en 1945, il demeurera presque intact et personne ne périra dans son enceinte.</strong></span></p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">En 1932, le père se rend aux Indes où il veut introduire sa revue. Il rêve de l'éditer aussi en turc, en arabe, en hébreu, etc. Après des rencontres avec des personnalités, à Ernakulam, il retourne à Nagasaki, puis il rentre en Pologne en 1933.</p> <p class=\"IntertitreDeArticle\">Quelques perles du père saint Maximilien Kolbe</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">« Je crois que dans chaque nation devrait surgir une ‘Cité de l’Immaculée’ qui permettrait à l’Immaculée d’agir par tous les moyens, y compris les plus modernes, car les découvertes devraient d’abord être employées à la servir, que ce soit dans le commerce, l’industrie, le sport, etc., et même la radio, le cinéma, en un mot tout ce que l’on pourrait découvrir et qui pourrait éclairer les esprits et enflammer les cœurs.&#160;»</p> <p class=\"petitAdroite\">(St Maximilien Kolbe, 02.12.1931, ESI. p.154)</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">« SI nous sommes donnés complètement à l’Immaculée, si nous désirons sans cesse être à elle, même si nos actions sont mauvaises, elle répare ; que voulez-vous de mieux !</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">Elle transforme tout pour le plus grand bien. Elle opère un miracle si c’est nécessaire, car pour l’Immaculée faire un miracle, ce n’est pas grand chose.</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">A ce moment, notre travail, notre effort ne seront plus à nous, mais à elle ; ils auront une valeur qui ne vient pas de nous mais de l’Immaculée.&#160;»</p> <p class=\"petitAdroite\">(St Maximilien Kolbe, 20.01.1937 : conférence, ESI, p.112) cité dans prière</p> <p>« L’essentiel n’est pas de beaucoup agir selon notre idée, mais d’être entre ses mains. Elle peut le mieux réaliser la gloire de Dieu, alors que nous, nous gâtons beaucoup de choses. Tout dépend de notre parfaite docilité à son égard. »</p> <p class=\"petitAdroite\">(St Maximilien Kolbe, 17.02.1938 : conférence)</p> <p>« Une brève invocation, pendant le travail, est la meilleure prière, et cela est bien pratique car on s’unit constamment et d’une façon toujours plus étroite à l’Immaculée, comme l’instrument dans la main de la maîtresse, et ainsi nous obtenons la grâce de l’illumination de l’intelligence (pour reconnaître sa volonté) et la puissance de la volonté (pour l’accomplir).&#160;»</p> <p class=\"petitAdroite\">(St Maximilien Kolbe, 15.10.1931, Lettre, ESI, p.136)</p> <p class=\"noteDeArticle\">ESI. : L’immaculée révèle l’Esprit Saint, entretiens spirituels du père Kolbe, Abbé J-F Villepelée.

Dans la seconde moitié du XV<sup>e</sup> siècle, on rajouta l'abside du choeur puis une sacristie au Nord-Est du transept. Mais le tiers de l'édifice s'effondra et il fallut reconstruire l'ensemble à partir de 1537, cinq ans seulement après l'annexion du duché de Bretagne à la France. Fermée sous la Révolution, rendue au culte sous le Consulat, la basilique a été restaurée de 1846 à 1880. Le 7 août 1944, des obus américains causèrent d'importants dégâts. Depuis 1960, d'importants réaménagements sont réalisés.&#160;</p>",

Elle est originale : le corps de Marie est constitué d'un morceau d'arbre, à peine travaillé. La Reine des Anges, dont le bras gauche est absent, porte son Fils qui a perdu son bras et son pied droits.</p> <p>Seul le buste de la Vierge est sculpté, causant une impression surprenante. L'oeuvre date du XVII<sup>e</sup> siècle sans qu'il soit possible d'en dire davantage. Les traits du visage de Marie (lèvres fines, cheveux ondulés et longs, nez aquilin, etc.) évoquent la physionomie de la Vierge de la Daurade à Toulouse. Une première statue d'une Vierge assise du XIII<sup>e</sup> siècle devait être vénérée mais elle a été perdue. Une confrérie du Rosaire administrait le pèlerinage en l'honneur de Notre-Dame de Miège-Coste dont la puissance d'intercession ne faisait aucune doute pour les habitants.</p> <p>La chapelle a été reconstruite en 1810. En 1856, une grande statue en pierre de Marie, les bras écartés, a été installée à son fronton. Cette oeuvre, entièrement détruite par la foudre le 30 mai 1945, a été remplacée par une sculpture non moins monumentale du sculpteur Jean Druilhe, en ciment coulé, le 4 mai 1947.</p> <p>&#160;</p>",

Elle ne dit rien. Pierina est éblouie et s'interroge.<br /> Le ler juin 1947, la dame apparaît de nouveau, moins transparente, plus réelle, mais toujours silencieuse. Des larmes coulent de ses yeux jusque sur le sol, trois grandes épées traversent sa poitrine. Elle prononce ces trois mots: Prière, sacrifice, pénitence.<br /> Lors de la deuxième apparition (13 juillet 1947), elle précise: \"Je suis la Mère de Jésus et la Mère de vous tous. Le Seigneur m'envoie pour promouvoir une plus efficace piété mariale dans les Instituts et Congrégations religieux [... ] et parmi les prêtres. Je promets à tous ceux qui m'honoreront, ma protection, un renouveau de vocations, moins d'apostasie, et un grand désir de sainteté. Que le 13 de chaque mois soit un jour de prière dédié à Marie et préparé durant les 12 premiers jours du mois. Je ferai descendre sur ce jour une abondance de grâces et de vocations.\"<br /> Pierina demande un miracle.<br /> Le miracle sera le renouveau spirituel des familles religieuses, selon l'esprit de leurs fondateurs, répond la Vierge.</p>",

Le 5 octobre 1971, l’apparition lui dit : « Cette fois-ci est la dernière fois que je viens vers vous. Je viendrai une autre fois seulement pour toi, à une date inconnue. » La Vierge apparaît 15 autres fois jusqu’au 5 novembre 1986. Phénomènes et guérisons sont évoqués. Caterina est une femme simple, pieuse, effacée. Chaque jour, elle prie sur le lieu des apparitions.</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">Les évêques diocésains successifs expriment leur réticence en diverses notifications : 15 juillet 1950, 28 juillet 1954, 25 juillet 1955 et 28 juin 1957. En 1969, le vicaire général du diocèse d’Albenga déclare : « Les apparitions ne contiennent vraisemblablement ni erreur théologique ou morale, ni aucune suggestion de nouvelle dévotion, mais aucun élément surnaturel. » En conséquence, il interdit aux fidèles de se rendre sur place.</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">Plus tard, l’évêque, Mgr Alessandro Piazza, prend acte des fruits spirituels (prière, conversions...). Le 28 juillet 1991, il bénit la petite chapelle édifiée en 1951 et la place sous l’administration de la paroisse. Son successeur, Mgr Mario Olivieri, ouvre une nouvelle enquête, couronne la statue et <strong>autorise le culte en cet endroit</strong>, sous le nom de « Notre-Dame de la Croix », le 7 octobre 1992.</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">Une Association de bienfaisance des amis du mont de la Croix a été créée. Ses membres, fervents de Notre-Dame de la Réconciliation, prennent une part active dans la vie paroissiale. Le 5 mai 2006, Mgr Mario Oliveri, évêque du diocèse, a présidé la procession de la statue (Madonna della Riconciliazione et della Pace).</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\"><span class=\"noteDeArticle\">Patrick SBALCHIERO, article « Balestrino », dans : René LAURENTIN et Patrick SBALCHIERO, Dictionnaire encyclopédique des apparitions de la Vierge.

Les événements se poursuivirent de façon intermittente sur toute la période en question, dans le même temps que la foule des pèlerins ne cessait d'augmenter.

Comme partout en Afrique la Vierge de Fatima est grandement vénérée dans ce pays. Cela explique pourquoi le sanctuaire fut bientôt dédié à Notre Dame de Fatima, le 11 octobre 1952, à la suite d’une nuit passée en veillée de prière.</p> <p>La fête annuelle est le 13 octobre, jour anniversaire de la dernière apparition de la Vierge à Fatima en 1917. Cette date représente une occasion si importante pour les fideles du pays qu’ils n’hésitent pas à marcher pendant trois jours, en portant sur la tête leurs couvertures et vêtements de fête, traversant les villages en chantant des hymnes, et puis repartant par le même chemin pour rentrer chez eux, toujours a pied, causant l’admiration même des non-catholiques.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Le sanctuaire marial de Willesden, à Londres, date au moins du XIIe siècle. Ce qui est certain c'est qu'après la conquête de l'Angleterre par les Normands, ces derniers érigèrent une église à Notre Dame de Willesden, une Vierge Noire, en 1170. Mais il aura fallu attendre la peste noire, fléau qui ravagea toute l'Europe au XIVe siècle, pour que le sanctuaire de Willesden devienne célèbre : on y venait en pèlerinage de toute l'Angleterre et même d'ailleurs, et l'on y participait à de grandes processions au cours desquelles la Madone accordait nombre de guérisons miraculeuses à ceux qui l'invoquaient avec ferveur. La Tradition rapporte qu'à l'origine de la dévotion à Notre Dame de Willesden, il y eut une apparition de la Vierge à un pèlerin, dans la prairie qui environnait le sanctuaire initial. Et pour que tous crurent au témoignage du pèlerin, Marie fit jaillir dans le pré, tout proche, une fontaine dont l'eau avait la propriété de guérir les malades, en particulier les troubles de la vue. Florissant pendant des siècles, le sanctuaire de Notre Dame de Willesden dut hélas cesser ses activités lors du schisme qui sépara l'Eglise d'Angleterre d'avec le&#160;Saint Siège : devenue \"anglicane\", l'institution ecclésiale anglaise fit fermer les lieux de culte marial et interdit le pèlerinage de Willesden qui disparut donc entre 1535 et 1885...</p> <p>... A l'époque, on ne badinait pas et le gouvernemant anglican de l'époque fit brûler nombre de statues de Madones ! Dieu merci, en 1885, grâce à l'arrivée à Willesden d'un saint prêtre (le père Bernard Ward, qui devint plus tard évêque de Brentwood), le sanctuaire reprit ses activités, ses pèlerinages et les processions à la Vierge Marie. De cette époque date la décision épiscopale de faire du 15 août, fête de l'Assomption de Marie, la fête officielle du sanctuaire de Willesden. Aujourd'hui et depuis la fin du XIXe siècle, chaque premier dimanche de mai a lieu la procession de Notre Dame de Willesden à travers les rues de Londres.</p> <p>En octobre 1954, pendant l'année mariale, la Vierge de Willesden fut couronnée solennellement au stade de Wembley, devant une foule de 100 000 personnes. Aujourd'hui, le sanctuaire marial, magnifiquement restauré au XIXe siècle, est rayonnant et très fréquenté. Son histoire&#160;montre avec puissance au visiteur ce que peut accomplir la ferveur mariale,&#160;au coeur même de&#160;contrées où le catholicisme fut rendu minoritaire par les infidélités des princes et des politiciens qui nous gouvernent. Au bord de la Tamise comme ailleurs, c'est avec un soin jaloux et tendre que Notre Dame de Willesden veille sur ses domaines et protège tous&#160;ses enfants.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A la fin de 1954, la fille cadette de la famille Klettner voit le Christ (\"<em>ensanglanté</em>\") et la Vierge Marie dans le jardin de la maison heures&#160; familiale.&#160; Plusieurs apparitions successives ont lieu au même endroit, et dans d'autres (maison, église paroissiale, etc.)</p> <p>Le fillette raconte son expérience et son entourage s'inquiète. La fillette est-elle la proie d'hallucinations pathologiques ? Faut-il en parler au clergé ? S'agit-il d'une illusion ? D'une éventuelle invention de l'enfant ? Et pourquoi en ce cas ?&#160; La famille est croyante, de&#160; mars tradition catholique, et n'écarte pas la possibilité d'un phénomène diabolique.</p> <p>Mais au soir du 13 octobre 1955, Aloisia Klettner (+ 1984), la mère de la voyant, et de 10 autres enfants, atteinte d'une grave paralysie des membres inférieurs, voit à son tour une \"<em>silhouette blanche et lumineuse</em>\" dans le jardin, exactement au même endroit où sa fille avait aperçu la Vierge.</p> <p>Aloisia est certaine du fait. Elle ne saurait être l'objet d'une quelconque illusion d'optique. Cette fois, les fidèles accourent jusqu'au domicile des Klettner.</p> <p>Le Puis le 6 septembre 1956, c'est le point d'orgue : Aloisia voit le Christ et elle se sent aussitôt guérie. Un phénomène rarissime est observée par les témoins : une \"<em>croix</em>\" (latine) aux contours nets et distincts s'est formée à l'endroit de la vision.</p> <p>Les croyants continuent de se rendre en un pèlerinage improvisé dans la maison d'Aloisia. Bientôt des messages, nombreux et extrêmement précis, sont reçus en locution intérieure : prière pour les âmes du purgatoire, fidélité au pape et aux évêques, mises en garde contre les erreurs doctrinales et les idées du \"modernisme\", etc.. En 1965, Aloisia est informé par Marie que le \"rideau de fer tombera\" (24 ans avant les faits).</p> <p>L'un des enfants d'Aloisia, Anne-Marie, est guérie mystérieusement à proximité de la \"<em>croix</em>\" dans le jardin (des certificats médicaux sont établis en toute rigueur).&#160;</p> <p>Le 5 novembre 1967, la Vierge déplore que les fidèles catholiques se détournent d'elle depuis Fatima (1917).*</p> <p>Le 19 mars 1968, à 14 heures 30, des dizaines de témoins allèguent un \"<em>miracle</em>\" du soleil, comme à Fatima, une \"<em>danse</em>\" de l'astre dans le ciel.</p> <p>Le 12 avril 1969, alors que jusque là le clergé avait suivi de loin les événements, décide d'intervenir face à des débordements de certains fidèles. L'évêque diocésain interdit toute célébration liturgique dans le jardin des appareitions, et demande à Aloisia de ne plus divulguer les messages reçus.&#160;</p> <p>Mais la voyante s'entête, ce qui peut arriver en certaines situations similaires. Le prélat l'excommunie puis revient sur sa décision, conscient de sa soumission et de son obéissance.</p> <p>En 1971, Aloisia, fatiguée et usée par ces années extraordinaires, place une statue de Notre-Dame dans son jardin. Selon des sources incontrôlables à ce jour, des personnes auraient vu le manteau de Marie \"<em>changer de couleur</em>\" et ses yeux, \"<em>s'animer</em>\".</p>",

Dolores, 45 ans, sans aucun 'antécédent' de cette nature.</p> <p>Les apparitions se poursuivent à un rythme irrégulier jusqu'en 1972, année au cours de laquelle elles prennent fin comme il avait été annoncé par la vision. Des messages sont rapportés : centrés sur la prière (personnelle et liturgique), ils demandent conversion, pénitence et paix.</p> <p>Le phénomène est resté privé, bien que les fidèles de Conchar aient récolté de bons fruits spirituels au long de ces années. Les autorités ecclésiastiques n'ont pas mené d'enquête et n'ont jamais statué sur le plan canonique.</p>",

        "description": "<p class=\"SecondLigneGrisRouge\">Histoire</p> <p class=\"troisiemeIntertitre\">la Sainte-Vierge et l'assassin (1)</p> <p>Selon la tradition, c’est à cet endroit précis qu’est apparue la Sainte-Vierge à un mystérieux « grand pécheur ». Selon l’histoire la plus répandue, il s’agirait d’un des massacreurs de la famille d’un seigneur d’Urfé. En effet au château des Cornes d’Urfé, les domestiques passèrent au fil du couteau toute la famille, à l’exception d’un bambin auquel, toujours d’après la tradition, les assassins donnèrent le choix entre une pomme et une piécette. Le choix du fruit lui laissa la vie sauve. Un des meurtriers, fuyant la justice, trouva refuge dans les bois noirs où la Bonne Mère lui apparut et lui demanda, pour le salut de son âme, de faire pénitence. Il devint le premier ermite de ces lieux.</p> <p class=\"troisiemeIntertitre\">La Mission Royale de Notre-Dame de l’Hermitage (1)</p> <p>La première église (construite non loin de la source et de sa chapelle) fut desservie par les Bénédictins de Noirétable dépendant de Cluny. Au XVIIe siècle, lutte contre le Protestantisme oblige, les Missionnaires investissent les lieux. Notre-Dame porte alors le nom de « Mission de Saint-Sauveur au désert » puis est rebaptisée « Mission Royale de Notre-Dame de l’Hermitage ». C’est messire Jacques Planat qui décida de construire le monastère à l’emplacement actuel, achevé en 1669 au prix d’efforts considérables.</p> <p class=\"troisiemeIntertitre\">De la Révolution à nos jours (1)</p> <p>Le bâtiment tel que le visiteur peut le voir de nos jours date de 1746. La Mission devient alors le noviciat, c’est à dire le centre de formation des apprentis missionnaires. La Révolution frappe de plein fouet l’établissement. Des prêtres sont guillotinés; d’autres entrent dans la clandestinité. Il fallut attendre près d’un siècle pour voir revenir une petite communauté, celle des Pères de l’Union au Très Saint Sacrement, qui relance le pèlerinage et restaure les bâtiments. En 1889, la communauté est remplacée par les Missionnaires de La Salette qui doivent s’en aller en 1905 (lois anti-cléricales) pour revenir en 1925,. La communauté actuelle compte cinq soeurs et trois novices originaires de France, de Madagascar et des Philippines. Depuis fin 2005, c'est soeur Sophie qui est le recteur de Notre-dame-de-l'Hermitage.</p> <p class=\"SecondLigneGrisRouge\">La statue de Notre-dame-de-l'Hermitage</p> <p class=\"troisiemeIntertitre\">Une œuvre de la fin du XIIe siècle (2)</p> <p>Au XIe siècle et au commencement du XIIe, l'Enfant Jésus est assis sur les genoux de sa Mère qui sont alors comme le trône du Tout-Puissant. Marie présente son Fils aux adorations des fidèles comme elle dut le présenter à celles des bergers et des Mages ; mais elle a à un tel degré conscience de la grandeur de ses fonctions de Sedes Sapientiae : Siège de la Sagesse, que, dans son respect pour le Maître du Monde, elle ose à peine le retenir de ses deux mains. A Orcival, la main gauche ne le touche même pas; elle se borne à esquisser le geste protecteur que fait la main droite. Ce type de statue où l'Enfant Jésus est majestueusement assis sur les genoux de sa Mère dans l'attitude d'un roi, se retrouve encore à la fin du XIIe siècle; mais il présente déjà plus d'une dérogation à la tradition. L'Enfant s'est levé ; il est maintenant représenté debout sur les genoux de sa Mère. Dans quelques années, la Vierge se lèvera à son tour et, à partir du XIIIe siècle, elle portera l'Enfant sur son bras gauche, quelquefois sur son bras droit. On voit quelle place il convient d'assigner, dans cette évolution, à la statue de l'Hermitage : c'est une œuvre de la fin du XIIe siècle - ou du commencement du XIIIe.</p> <p class=\"troisiemeIntertitre\">Perdue puis retrouvée (3)</p> <p>La statue de Notre-dame-de-l'Hermitage perdue à l'époque de la Révolution a été retrouvée en juin 1969 au hameau de Grandris (Saint-Didier) chez Joannès et Henri Moulin ; transférée à la Diana en novembre 1978, elle fut restaurée par Louis Bernard en 1979 et rendue à l'Hermitage le 2 septembre 1979</p> <p class=\"SecondLigneGrisRouge\">A voir aussi</p> <p class=\"troisiemeIntertitre\">Les deux rochers de Peyrotine (1)</p> <p>Les deux rochers de Peyrotine, en granit.

        "description": "<p>Du 5 avril 1970 au 6 octobre 1978, la commune de Dozulé (France, Normandie, Calvados) fut le théâtre d'apparitions du Christ, d'une \"croix glorieuse\" (au sommet de la colline de la 'Haute Butte'), de la Vierge (une seule fois, le 31 mai 1974), de l'archange saint Michel, ce à quoi il faut ajouter des phénomènes eucharistiques, des \"messages\" demandant l'érection d'une croix de 738 mètres de haut, et le retour imminent du Seigneur sur terre, ainsi que la découverte d'une source (5 octobre 1973). Le témoin principal s'appelle Madeleine Aumont, née le 27 octobre 1924, mariée et mère de cinq enfants, couturière de métier.</p> <p>Le curé de la paroisse, l'abbé L'Horset, a tenu à jour des procès-verbaux informant de l'évolution des faits. Il a communiqué à l'évêque diocésain les diverses pièces de ce dossier de façon régulière.</p> <p>Nombre de pèlerins se rendent sur les lieux depuis la fin des années 70. Mais la commission d'enquête, crée en avril 1984, sans d'ailleurs juger les phénomènes alléguées, est négative. L'ordonnance épiscopale de l'évêque (24 juin 1985) restreint la diffusion (audio et imprimée) des messages et canalise les rassemblements de fidèles tenus sans autorisation des autorités de l'Eglise.</p> <p>Dans une lettre adressée à l'évêque de Bayeux-Lisieux le 25 octobre 1985, le cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, futur Benoît XVI, alors Préfet de la Congrégation pour la Doctrine de la Foi, approuve sans restriction la position de la commission. Le 8 décembre suivant, puis le 15 mars 1991, l'évêque du diocèse publie deux déclarations évoquant l'aspect \"inacceptable\" des faits et le \"pseudo-message\" de Dozulé. </p>",

Cette église a rejoint le rang des basiliques mineures en avril 1980, à l’approche de la canonisation du Bx Maximilien Kolbe (10 octobre 1982) et de la visite du Pape Jean-Paul II quelques mois après (juin 1983).

De plus, il n'est pas exceptionnel qu'une 'épidémies' de 'merveilleux' naisse à partir d'un événement réel proche sur le plan géographique (Lourdes, Pontmain, Fatima, Beauraing, etc.).&#160;</p>",

Soudain, un liquide huileux coule des mains de Myrna. Une femme propose d’oindre le corps de la malade : aussitôt, elle s’en trouve mieux.</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">Le 27 novembre 1982, Myrna remarque à son domicile qu’une petite image de la Vierge à l’Enfant (Notre Dame de Kazan), achetée par son mari lors d’un séjour en Bulgarie et placée dans un cadre en plastique, brille anormalement. Elle voit un liquide couler, semblable à de l’huile d’olive. Son époux fait le même constat. Décontenancé, Nicolas part prévenir des amis en demandant à son épouse de n’ouvrir à personne. Myrna reçoit alors en locution : « Ma fille, Marie [Myrna], ne crains pas, je suis avec toi. Ouvrez les portes, ne privez personne de ma vue. »</p> <p class=\"textDeArticle\">Le 15 décembre 1982, vers vingt trois heures, la Vierge apparaît à Myrna pour la première fois.</p>",

Des dizaines de fidèles accourent sur les lieux. Les autorités ecclésiastiques restent prudentes, bien que la réputation de piété et de sincérité de la voyante ne fut pas remise en cause.</p> <p>Le 8 juillet 1984, Joséphine voit Marie une seconde fois, sous des traits identiques. Puis les apparitions se multiplient, presque chaque jour jusqu'en 1987. Nombre d'entre elles se déroulent en présence de centaines de personnes entourant Joséphine, au hameau de Spink.</p> <p>Des messages ont été recueillis, insistant sur des thèmes récurrents et habituels dans le cadre des mariophanies contemporaines : récitation du Rosaire, conversion de l'humanité, ce à quoi il faut ajouter deux propositions liturgiques assez mal reçues par le clergé, selon la tradition la plus ancienne de l'Eglise : le \"<em>chapêlet de la divine miséricorde</em>\" et le \"<em>chapelet des sept douleurs</em>\".</p> <p>Joséphine a laissé une description d'une apparition qui, sur le plan théologique, pose difficulté (l'Esprit Saint n'est jamais 'vu' tel un être spirituel) : \"<em>A Abbeyleix, j'ai vu l'Esprit-Saint au-dessus de la Vierge, et une inscription en lettres d'or : 'Je suis l'Immaculée Conception.' Ces lettres étaient formées d'étoiles brillantes.</em>\"</p> <p>Entre 10 et 30 personnes visitent Joséphine chaque jour à son domicile. Elle a été contrainte d'interrompre son activité professionnelle pour les recevoir et organiser un groupe de prière. Toutefois, l'évêque diocésain ne la reçoit pas et n'a pas décidé d'enquêter publiquement sur ces faits.</p>",

        "description": "<p class=\"textDeChapeau\">Lors de sa visite &agrave; Lugano le 12 juin 1984, le pape Jean Paul II a b&eacute;ni une statue de la Vierge Marie. L&rsquo;ann&eacute;e suivante, les jeunes l&rsquo;ont mont&eacute;e sur le mont Tamaro. Maintenant, le projet s&rsquo;est form&eacute; de construire un sanctuaire, sainte Marie des anges.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeChapeau\">Il est sans doute bon de se souvenir de l&rsquo;enseignement du pape Jean Paul II le jour o&ugrave; il a b&eacute;ni cette statue. Son enseignement a port&eacute; sur l&rsquo;Eglise &agrave; la fois locale et universelle. Ce n&rsquo;est pas un th&egrave;me &eacute;loign&eacute; de notre sujet, Marie est m&egrave;re de l&rsquo;Eglise.</p>\r\n<p class=\"texte_boitebleu\">&laquo; Ils se montraient assidus &agrave; l'enseignement des ap&ocirc;tres, fid&egrave;les &agrave; la communion fraternelle, &agrave; la fraction du pain et aux pri&egrave;res. &raquo; (Ac 2, 42).</p>\r\n<p>Le texte du second chapitre des Actes des ap&ocirc;tres nous met devant les yeux les d&eacute;buts m&ecirc;mes de l'&Eacute;glise, &agrave; peine sortie du c&eacute;nacle le jour de Pentec&ocirc;te. [&hellip;]  Cette communaut&eacute; maintient encore une liaison quotidienne avec le temple de J&eacute;rusalem, et participe donc encore au culte de l'ancienne alliance, et en m&ecirc;me temps, en rompant le pain &agrave; la maison (cf. Ac 2, 46) elle c&eacute;l&egrave;bre d&eacute;j&agrave; l'eucharistie, le sacrement de l&rsquo;alliance nouvelle et &eacute;ternelle.  [&hellip;] L'&Eacute;glise des premiers temps est - on pourrait dire - l'&Eacute;glise &quot;locale&quot; et en m&ecirc;me temps aussi l'&Eacute;glise &quot;universelle&quot;. &quot;Locale&quot;, parce que li&eacute;e &agrave; un endroit, &agrave; J&eacute;rusalem ; mais aussi &quot;universelle&quot;, parce qu'en elle confluent des gens provenants de diff&eacute;rentes nations.   La visite de l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que de Rome et successeur de Pierre veut montrer, avec une &eacute;vidence sp&eacute;ciale, comment votre dioc&egrave;se de Lugano et tous les dioc&egrave;ses de la Suisse - chaque des &Eacute;glises qui se trouvent dans votre patrie - en vivant leur propre vie, vivent aussi la vie de l'&Eacute;glise universelle: de l'&Eacute;glise qui est &laquo; une &raquo; dans le monde entier. [&hellip;]  La liturgie d'aujourd'hui nous parle de cette unit&eacute; par l'analogie &eacute;vang&eacute;lique de la vigne et des sarments. J&eacute;sus dit &agrave; ses disciples pendant le discours d'adieu, au c&eacute;nacle :  &quot;Je suis la vraie vigne et mon P&egrave;re c'est le vigneron&quot; (Jn 15, 1)   Sur la terre de l'humanit&eacute; le P&egrave;re du ciel a greff&eacute; cette vigne: le Fils de Dieu n&eacute; dans le temps de la Vierge Marie. Et tous les hommes sont comme des sarments p&eacute;n&eacute;tr&eacute;s par la s&egrave;ve de la nouvelle vie. [&hellip;] L&agrave; o&ugrave; une communaut&eacute; est r&eacute;unie avec son &eacute;v&ecirc;que, dans la foi et dans la fid&eacute;lit&eacute; au Seigneur ressuscit&eacute;, elle est vraiment l'&Eacute;glise. Mais la r&eacute;alit&eacute; du corps mystique de Christ ne s'&eacute;puise pas en elle. L'&Eacute;glise particuli&egrave;re ne peut pas rester seule, elle ne peut pas vivre une fraternit&eacute; seulement au niveau local, mais elle doit r&eacute;aliser la communion aussi avec les autres &Eacute;glises. Dans le Nouveau Testament nous lisons comment d&eacute;j&agrave; entre les diff&eacute;rentes &Eacute;glises de cette &eacute;poque il y avait une unit&eacute;, exprim&eacute;e par l&rsquo;&eacute;change d'aides et d&rsquo;informations, des voyages et l&rsquo;accueil de gens, et surtout par l'adh&eacute;sion ferme &agrave; la m&ecirc;me foi, aux m&ecirc;mes sacrements, &agrave; la pratique disciplinaire introduite par les ap&ocirc;tres d'un commun accord et constamment ajourn&eacute;e par leurs successeurs. Le livre des Actes nous informe en particulier que ces communaut&eacute;s continuaient &agrave; faire r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; un centre, &agrave; une &Eacute;glise m&egrave;re, qui &eacute;tait alors J&eacute;rusalem, l'endroit o&ugrave;, dans un premier temps, Pierre vivait avec les autres ap&ocirc;tres.  ___________</p>\r\n<p class=\"petitAdroite\">Jean Paul II, Hom&eacute;lie au stade &quot;Cornadero&quot; (Lugano), Mardi, le 12 juin 1984</p>\r\n<p class=\"petitAdroite\">Source : www.vatican.va, traduit de l&rsquo;italien par F.Breynaert.</p>",

Elle lui donna la mission de prêcher le Rosaire. Les apparitions se sont déroulées de manière successive, en particulier les samedis. Dans un de ses messages, Marie lui dit :</p> <blockquote> <p>« Mes enfants ! Vous me faites souffrir en transperçant le cœur de mon fils avec vos pêchés…Préparez-vous donc à supporter sa colère… Chacun devrait décharger son cœur des biens périssables du monde avant qu’il n’en arrive à sa fin, qui est proche ».</p> </blockquote> <p>Le supérieur de Cyril doutait de l’authenticité des apparitions jusqu’au 18 Janvier 1985 quand il trouva une statue de la Vierge Marie, versant des larmes de sang dans la chapelle du couvent. Cette manifestation a aussi touché l’Archevêque Joaquim Ruhuna de Gitega qui reconnut les apparitions et les messages comme véritables. Il fit construire une église, qu’il consacra le 13 Octobre 1986 et la confia aux Sœurs de Sainte Bernadette. Au début, le visionnaire souffrit de persécutions sévères du démon. La dernière apparition publique fut le 15 Septembre 1986.</p>",

Rentré chez lui, il recouvrit la vue devant une statue de la Vierge Marie qui \"<em>versa des larmes</em>\" pendant trois jours, selon le témoignage de dizaines de témoins.&#160;</p> <p>En 1989, Joseph effectua un second voyage à Medjugorje où il vit le \"<em>Christ du calvaire</em>\" du cimetière du village, \"<em>saigner abondamment</em>\". Le 15 août 1990, en la fête de l'Assomption, Marie lui apparût \"<em>dans une vive lumière</em>\" puis une seconde fois, le 1<sup>er </sup>novembre suivant, accompagnée de l'archange saint Michel.&#160; La Vierge était belle, âgée d'environ 18 ans, brune, les yeux bleus. Son aspect a changé au cours du temps : ceinte d'une couronne, vêtue de blanc ou de bleu, elle portait souvent l'enfant Jésus.</p>",

Humble paysan, il devient un ‘voyant’ de la Vierge Marie au printemps 1980 sans que rien ne l’ait préparé à une telle grâce. Chrétien convaincu, pieux et plein de bon sens, Bernardo est sujet à de fréquentes visions à partir de cette date. Il recueille des messages ‘célestes’ dont certains annoncent des catastrophes si les hommes ne se convertissent pas. Ces ‘communications’ ont duré jusqu’en 1991 au moins.</p> <p>L’évêque de son diocèse (Juigalpa) a apprécié sa personnalité et la qualité évangélique des messages. Peu instruit dans sa jeunesse, Bernardo a choisi d’approfondir sa foi et ses connaissances. Il a été ordonné prêtre en 1995.</p>",

Cette expérience se renouvelle le 1er janvier 1992, elle est d’une incroyable beauté. Il témoigne :</p> <blockquote> <p>« Je tombai à genoux avec une grande paix. Je lui demande : “Qui êtes-vous ? Que voulez-vous ?” Elle n’a pas répondu à la question, mais elle a dit : “Dieu a un plan particulier pour le monde depuis ce lieu. Il vous invite à entrer dans son plan”. Sans réfléchir, je réponds : “Oui, je veux bien.” “N’en dites rien”, conclut-elle.</p> <p>Vers la fin de l’année 1992, elle m’a invité à dévoiler l’apparition et presque aussitôt après, le 1er janvier 1993, quand j’arrive pour prier à l’heure habituelle : quatorze heures, un groupe de dix-sept personnes était déjà là. Pourtant je n’en avais parlé qu’à une de mes cousines, qui ne croyait même pas en Dieu. Mais elle en avait parlé à sa soeur qui en avait convaincu d’autres. L’affluence fut croissante jusqu’à 30 000 et même 100 000 personnes en 1993 pour le 15 août. »<br /> &#160;</p> </blockquote>",

En 1995 a été inaugurée la nouvelle cathédrale, construite à 60 mètres au-dessous de la première.</p> <p>Une statue de la Vierge Marie (haut : 70 cm), oeuvre de Daniel Rodriguez Moreno, orne l'autel. Cette oeuvre était conservée dans le premier édifice dans la chapelle de Notre-Dame du Rosaire, au fond de la nef principale.

        "description": "<p class=\"SecondLigneGrisRouge\">Avioth, un petit village et une grande basilique</p> <p>Avioth (103 habitants) est situé dans le département de la Meuse à 20 km de Florenville. Ce modeste village s'orne de façon tout-à-fait inattendue d'une merveilleuse basilique gothique édifiée de 1250 à 1400. L'intérieur recèle de très beaux ornements mais c'est à l'extérieur que se trouve le plus étonnant : la Recevresse.</p> <p class=\"troisiemeIntertitre\">La \"Recevresse\"</p> <p>« La Recevresse » est un monument unique au monde et sa reproduction, grandeur nature, se trouve au musée national des monuments français à Paris. Ce chef d’œuvre du gothique flamboyant a vraisemblablement été construit à l’endroit de la découverte de la statue miraculeuse \"sur son buisson d’épines\". Il remplace un premier oratoire plus modeste. Au début du XIVème siècle, lorsque la statue de Notre-Dame d’Avioth put entrer dans son église, une autre statue de la Vierge pris sa place pour recevoir, en son nom, les offrandes des pèlerins. On appela cette statue : la Vierge Recevresse.</p> <p class=\"SecondLigneGrisRouge\">Origine du pèlerinage</p> <p>Avioth, situé à la frontière belge, ne doit son existence qu'à son pèlerinage. Selon la tradition, des bergers découvrirent dans un buisson une statue de la Vierge. Un sanctuaire fut érigé au cours de la seconde partie du XIe siècle sur les lieux mêmes de la découverte, peut-être sous l'impulsion des cisterciens de l'abbaye voisine d'Orval. Les pèlerins venant vénérer la Vierge devinrent si nombreux que rapidement l'édifice s'avéra trop petit. Une nouvelle église fut édifiée à partir de la deuxième moitié du XIII` siècle. Grâce à un pieux manuscrit intitulé « Brief recueuil de l'estat de l'Eglise Notre Dame d'Avioth fait en l'an 1668 par Mr. Jean Delhotel, humble curé du dit Avioth », nous connaissons un peu l'origine de l'église et l’histoire de son pèlerinage. Notre chroniqueur explique en effet : « J'ai appris de mes ancêtres, qui eux-mêmes l'avaient recueilli comme une pieuse tradition, que cette image, l'une des plus grandes que nous connaissons parmi les Images miraculeuses de la Vierge avait été bâtie des anges, envoyée du ciel en terre et déposée en un lieu où elle trône encore dans son église d'Avioth, sous une pyramide délicatement sculptée.» Le manuscrit renferme de nombreux faits précis, la plupart datés : accidents graves sans conséquences, délivrances extraordinaires de prisonniers, guérisons de maladies graves telles que le choléra. Mais surtout, l'abbé Delhotel s’étend dans sa relation sur le « répit » temporaire des enfants morts sans baptême.</p> <p class=\"troisiemeIntertitre\">Notre Dame d'Avioth, sanctuaire à répit</p> <p>Selon la croyance populaire en certaines provinces, le « répit » est, chez un enfant mort-né, un retour temporaire à la vie le temps de lui conférer le baptême avant la mort définitive. Ayant été baptisé, l’enfant pourra de ce fait entrer en paradis au lieu d’errer dans les limbes où il serait privé de la vision de Dieu. Les enfants mort-né étaient apportés dans un panier et venaient souvent de fort loin : Bastogne, Marville, Habay, Arrancy, distants de plusieurs lieues d'Avioth. Quelle que soit la saison, ils étaient exposés nus aux pieds de la statue de la Vierge, à même la pierre. Tous les assistants, appelés au son de la cloche, se mettaient en prières. On chantait le Salve Regina puis les litanies en l'honneur de la Vierge. Certains faisaient célébrer la messe, se confessaient et communiaient, «afin de pouvoir plus efficacement incliner la Vierge Marie de leur obtenir de Dieu son Fils, grâces et miséricordes pour ces enfants à leur grande consolation.» Alors des signes de vie pouvaient apparaitre : «le mouvement des veines des membres revient, la couleur de noir devient vermeille, l'effusion du sang ou une sueur chaude survient » note le chroniqueur. En présence de ces symptômes le baptême, sous conditions, était donné : \"Si tu es en vie, je te baptise...\" Aussitôt après les signes de mort réapparaissaient et l'enfant était inhumé à l’est de l’église.</p> <p class=\"SecondLigneGrisRouge\">le pape Jean-Paul II accorde à l’église Notre Dame d'Avioth le titre de basilique.</p> <p>Le pèlerinage séculaire de Notre-Dame se poursuit encore de nos jours. Chaque année, tous les 16 juillet, de nombreux Lorrains, Belges et Luxembourgeois sont nombreux à venir prier et participer à la procession. À ce titre, en 1993, le pape Jean-Paul II a reconnu l’importance du pèlerinage en accordant à l’église le titre de basilique.</p> <p class=\"noteDeArticle\">________________</p> <p class=\"noteDeArticle\">Source : http://www.avioth.fr (Ch.

Cependant, la femme du gouverneur de Gray l'accepta, elle,&#160;en offrande pour son mari qui était très malade et désespéré de son état. Or, dès qu'il vit la Vierge sculptée, le Gouverneur retrouva la sérénité et&#160;put mourir doucement, dans une grande paix . L'épouse du Gouverneur conserva la précieuse Vierge et mit du temps avant de consentir à l'offrir au couvent des Capucins de Gray.</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">Mais dès que la statuette fut installée sur l'autel des Capucins, elle attira la dévotion des foules et obtint quantité de miracles, particulièrement en guérissant des enfants malades.</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">Le premier miracle connu de la Vierge de Gray, fut la guérison,&#160;le 17&#160;février 1620&#160;du jeune Voisin, 10 ans, qui était infirme et mourant en arrivant et qui rentra chez lui complètement guéri. Ensuite il y eut beaucoup d'autres guérisons spectatculaires et les pèlerinages se multiplièrent.</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">En 1634, la Vierge de Gray fut triplement couronnée et à cette occasion on annonça que 2500 miracles s'étaient produits depuis celui du jeune Voisin, 14 ans auparavant.</p> <p class=\"retraitLigne\">C'est ainsi qu'une humble statuette dont au début personne ne voulait tant elle était petite,&#160;est devenue&#160;la Madone aimée, admirée et si puissante sur le Coeur de Dieu, que ses prodigieuses grâces lui attirent toujours de plus en plus de pèlerins.</p>",

Des messages de Marie sont divulgués puis transmis parmi les fidèles : à la fois une problématique 'traditionnelle' : prière, sacrements, conversion, etc. et une thématique plus prophétique, sinon apocalyptique : \"Des choses terribles vont arriver sur cette terre mais ceux qui prient seront sauvés. Beaucoup vont périr.\" (17 novembre 1998).</p> <p>L'apparition révèle son identité céleste le 17 avril 1999 : \"Ayez confiance en moi, car je suis la Mère de la Miséricorde. C'est à partir de cette terre de l'Afrique aura la paix.\" Le message du 13 mai 1999 met magnifiquement en relation doctrine théologique et valeur suprême de la foi chrétienne : la charité : \"Celui qui m'aime me croit, celui qui ne m'aime pas ne me croit pas.\"</p>",

Elle conserve la châsse de Notre-Dame Flamande, reliquaire en bois de l'orfèvre mosan, Nicolas de Verdun. Elle abrite les reliques déposées dans la cathédrale jusqu'au XIIe siècle.Sa décoration est importante : le Christ et Marie sont représentés aux pignons ; le toit et les côtés montrent des scènes de leur vies.<br /> &#160;</p>",

        "description": "<p>Des c<span>olons en provenance du Mexique et des missionnaires franciscains ont introduit aux 17e et 18e siècles le culte de Notre-Dame de Guadalupe au Nouveau-Mexique. Le Sanctuaire de Notre-Dame de Guadalupe à Santa Fe, Nouveau Mexique, est donc le plus ancien sanctuaire encore debout qui ait été construit aux États-Unis en l'honneur de la Vierge Marie. Il s'agit d'un point de repère durable, commémorant la forte présence de la Vierge de Guadalupe patronne des Amériques. La première église consacrée à&#160;Notre-Dame de Guadalupe était un tout petit édifice en pisé, construit en 1777 au bord de la rivière Santa Fe.<br /> <br /> Au début du 19e siècle, l'église n'était pas en bon état et ne pouvait plus être utilisée pour le culte divin. En 1922, un incendie détruisit la toiture et détériora les fresques peintes. Une restauration fut alors effectuée dans le style des missions de Californie, un nouveau clocher fut érigé et un plancher&#160;en bois installé. Après quoi, ce sanctuaire de Notre-Dame de Guadalupe devint une paroisse active jusqu'en 1961, époque à laquelle il&#160;fut fermé à tout service religieux. <br /> <br /> L'ancienne église a finalement et pour la seconde fois été restaurée, et les murs en pisé, de près de 90 cm d'épaisseur, ont été réparés. Le 5 août 2006, l'archevêque de Santa Fe a consacré à nouveau le sanctuaire de Notre-Dame de Guadalupe, qui a été officiellement déclaré, et&#160;consacré en tant que lieu de culte.</span></p> <p>&#160;</p>",

Elle a été choisie par Jean-Paul II lui-même. Le Souverain Pontife considérait \"<em>Marie Mère de l'Eglise</em>\" comme une réalité essentielle exprimant l'union et l'unité entre Marie et les chrétiens du monde entier. Cette oeuvre est inspirée d'une autre image de la Vierge, conservée dans la basilique Saint-Pierre, bénie par Jean-Paul II le 8 décembre 1981. Une plaque en marbre portant le blason pontifical avait été posée peu après à l'emplacement où le pape avait avait été touché par l'attentat.</p> <p>Ce même blason a été fixé à la base de l'actuelle mosaïque, avec sa devise mariale <em>Totus tuus</em>.&#160; &#160;</p>",

Dès l'enfance, elle désira suivre \"<em>les traces de ma Dame bienheureuse, Marie, Mère de Dieu</em>\", son idéal étant de s'unir \"<em>au fils de nulle autre sinon de celle qui, Vierge, a conçu Vierge a enfanté et Vierge est demeurée</em>\" (<em>AASS</em>, III-II, 222, n. 3).&#160;</p> <p>Peu avant de mourir, elle dit aux religieuses qui entouraient son lit de mort : \"<em>Voici que vient ma Dame, la Bienheureuse Vierge Marie, à qui je vous confie...</em>\" Puis elle \"<em>étendit les bras comme si elle voulait embrasser la Mère de Dieu</em>...\"</p>",

Pour une guérison totale, il ne faut pas seulement le regret et la rémission des fautes, mais aussi une réparation du désordre provoqué qui continu habituellement à subsister.</blockquote> <blockquote>Dans cet engagement de purification le pénitent n'est pas isolé. Il se trouve inséré dans un mystère de solidarité par lequel la sainteté du Christ et des Saints lui est aussi très utile. Dieu lui communique les grâces méritées par d'autres avec l'immense valeur de leur existence, pour rendre plus rapide et efficace sa réparation. […] Les pasteurs accordent un tel bienfait à qui a les justes dispositions intérieures et accomplit quelques actes prescrits. Cette intervention dans le chemin pénitentiel est la concession de l'Indulgence. »\r\n<p class=\"petitAdroite\">(Conférence épiscopale italienne, Catéchisme des adultes N° 710).</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"IntertitreDeArticle\">Fêtes</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>2 août (« pardon d’Assise »)</li>\r\n    <li>15 août  3-4 octobre (saint François) 8 décembre.&#160;</li>\r\n</ul>",

On l'installa rapidement dans une niche située dans la façade d'une maison, dans une rue rebaptisée pour l'occasion, rue de la Vierge noire. Sous la Révolution française, la statue fut cachée par une femme jusqu'en 1824.</p>",

Savinien fait construire un oratoire à Ferrières, dans le en l’honneur de la Vierge et convoque les néophytes de la région. Selon le récit de fondation, « un prodige insigne vint confirmer dans la foi ces nouveaux chrétiens. C’était la nuit de Noël, et on allait commencer le saint sacrifice lorsque tout à coup une vive lumière remplit le sanctuaire : la Sainte Vierge apparaît, portant l’Enfant Jésus dans ses bras, accompagnée de saint Joseph ; et les anges, s’associant à cette glorieuse apparition, entonnent comme autrefois le Gloria in excelsis. Saisi d’un saint enthousiasme, Savinien s’écrie : \"C’est vraiment ici Bethléem.\" Et depuis lors jusqu’à nos jours, ce nom est toujours resté au sanctuaire » Les troupes d’Attila (v. 395-453) incendient la chapelle. Clovis (v. 465-511) s’y serait rendu en 481. La garde du sanctuaire est confiée à des ermites.</p> <p class=\"IntertitreDeArticle\">L’abbaye de Ferrières-en-Gâtinais</p> <p>Le bâtiment actuel de l'église Notre-Dame-de-Bethléem conserve des traces du IXe siècle : quatre masques et l'empreinte d'une tour-porche sur la façade reconstruite au XIXe siècle. Deux statues du XVe siècle, sainte Anne en pierre et Notre-Dame-de-Bethléem en bois, protègent le sanctuaire. C'est Clovis qui aurait fait édifier le monastère. Appartenant au domaine royal, l'abbaye se trouve alors protégée des ambitions des autres seigneurs locaux. À l'époque carolingienne, le rayonnement culturel de son école et de son scriptorium est tel qu'elle compte alors près de 80 religieux. Après l'invasion normande, elle connaît une nouvelle de prospérité au XIIe et XIIIe siècle. Pourtant, l'essentiel des bâtiments est construit au XVe siècle.

        "description": "<p class=\"textDeArticle\"><span class=\"LettrineRouge\">A</span>rriv&eacute; de Grenoble, &agrave; l'&acirc;ge de dix ans, Amatus, Am&eacute; ou Aim&eacute; avait &eacute;t&eacute; confi&eacute; aux moines de la royale abbaye. Ses &eacute;tudes achev&eacute;es, il voulut, lui aussi, se cacher sous le froc, pour grandir aux yeux de Dieu. Trente ans, il avait &eacute;difi&eacute; ses confr&egrave;res par son recueillement, son humilit&eacute;, sa parfaite ob&eacute;issance et sa fraternelle charit&eacute;, quand, un beau matin, sa place resta vide au choeur ; dans le clo&icirc;tre on le chercha, il resta introuvable. Qu'&eacute;tait donc devenu le saint moine, celui que tout le monde aimait tant et qui aimait tant tout le monde ? On chercha longtemps le bon fr&egrave;re Am&eacute;, et ce n'est qu'au bout de trois jours d'anxi&eacute;t&eacute; qu'on finit par d&eacute;couvrir l&agrave;-haut, au flanc du rocher qui surmonte l'abbaye, le nouvel anachor&egrave;te. Comme Antoine, Hilarion et tant d'autres, une voix avait retenti au fond de son &acirc;me :</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">&laquo; Viens, viens, lui avait dit le Divin Ma&icirc;tre, viens dans la solitude ; l&agrave;, je parlerai &agrave; ton coeur, avec plus d'intimit&eacute; que jamais. &raquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Des d&eacute;marches sont faites pour qu&rsquo;il rentre au monast&egrave;re. Il fut toutefois convenu que tous les trois jours, un de ses anciens confr&egrave;res de l'abbaye viendrait lui apporter du pain d'orge et un peu d'eau.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Plus tard, &agrave; la pri&egrave;re de l'anachor&egrave;te, l'eau jaillit du rocher ; il se mit aussi &agrave; d&eacute;fricher un petit terrain et l'orge qu'il y sema suffit &agrave; son entretien. Le je&ucirc;ne, les veilles, la pri&egrave;re, l'Eucharistie et la Sainte Vierge, c'est de cela que son &acirc;me vivait.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Le d&eacute;mon, qui a os&eacute; tenter J&eacute;sus dans le d&eacute;sert, ne devait pas manquer de harceler son serviteur. Un jour, dit la l&eacute;gende, ce perfide ennemi imagina d'&eacute;craser le pauvre abri du c&eacute;nobite en faisant d&eacute;valer des blocs de rocher. Fr&egrave;re Am&eacute; ne s'&eacute;pouvanta pas. Il fit le signe de la croix et interpellant la roche qui descendait : &laquo; Au nom de J&eacute;sus-Christ, je te l'ordonne, arr&ecirc;te-toi. &raquo; Les blocs s'arr&ecirc;t&egrave;rent, l'ermite et sa cellule furent &eacute;pargn&eacute;s.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Un jour, saint Eustaise emmena avec lui le pieux solitaire qui dut s&ucirc;rement faire un grand sacrifice en quittant son pieux ermitage, sa chapelle tant aim&eacute;e, la vue de sa ch&egrave;re Abbaye, et celle du champ des Martyrs. Une double mission l'attendait. Et d'abord, celle d'&eacute;vang&eacute;liser l'Austrasie, qui manquait de pr&eacute;dicateurs. Celle de construire un monast&egrave;re pour les moniales.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Il mourut, comme meurent les saints, dans les sentiments de la plus profonde humilit&eacute;, mais aussi de la plus filiale confiance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\"><span class=\"LettrineRouge\">R</span>evenons &agrave; la chapelle du Scex ; le saint ermite n'est plus l&agrave; pour nous y accueillir, mais la Tr&eacute;sori&egrave;re des gr&acirc;ces, la M&egrave;re du Sauveur est rest&eacute;e. Elle sait que ses enfants ont besoin d'Elle, et Elle les attend toujours, pr&ecirc;te &agrave; les consoler, &agrave; les secourir. L&rsquo;abbaye de St-Maurice a toujours veill&eacute; sur ce sanctuaire, elle a toujours su y entretenir le feu sacr&eacute; de la d&eacute;votion &agrave; Marie.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">De son c&ocirc;t&eacute;, la M&egrave;re de J&eacute;sus a continu&eacute; &agrave; multiplier les preuves de sa tendresse maternelle. Il y a dans la plupart de ces ex-voto beaucoup de myst&egrave;res, mais ce qui appara&icirc;t toujours, c'est que dans la peine, &agrave; l'heure de l'&eacute;preuve, on a pri&eacute; et la M&egrave;re a consol&eacute;. Elle a secouru ses enfants.</p>\r\n<p>Une de ces faveurs bien frappantes, c'est assur&eacute;ment le fait de cet enfant qui tombe du toit de la chapelle jusqu'au pied du rocher et son seul souci quand il arrive, c'est de chercher son chapeau pour rejoindre ensuite bien vite son p&egrave;re alarm&eacute;.</p>\r\n<p class=\"textDeArticle\">Il y a des chutes autrement dangereuses, celle de l'&acirc;me dans le p&eacute;ch&eacute;. Combien en est-il que la Vierge Immacul&eacute;e toute pure, toute bonne, a retenus au bord de l'ab&icirc;me, combien pour qui elle a &eacute;t&eacute; le Refuge, la M&egrave;re de Mis&eacute;ricorde, l'Avocate du pardon. Ces gr&acirc;ces de conversion, de r&eacute;surrection spirituelle sont assur&eacute;ment les plus grandes, les plus pr&eacute;cieuses ; pour celles-l&agrave;, il n'y a pas d'ex-voto sur la terre, elles ne s'&eacute;crivent qu'au Ciel et dans les c&oelig;urs.</p>",

Le début de l'histoire révèle l'attention de la Vierge Marie envers ses enfants perdus, égarés, et qui ont soif...</p>\r\n<blockquote>Au XVIIIe siècle, une fillette, âgée de douze ou treize ans, accompagnée de sa mère, ramasse des fagots dans un bois. Elle s’éloigne de sa mère et s’égare. Elle prend peur et se met à pleurer. « J’ai grand soif », dit-elle. La Vierge lui apparaît. « Pourquoi pleures-tu ? », lui demande l’apparition. Une source jaillit aux pieds de la voyante qui entend : «Bois et va dire à la population de ce village de venir ici pour m’y construire une chapelle.»[1] </blockquote>\r\n<p>La Vierge Marie, en demandant de construire une chapelle, indique que Jésus est la source que l'humanité recherche.   Une apparition a quelque chose d'extraordinaire, et la voyante est la seule à pouvoir témoigner de sa réalité objective, aussi demande-elle un signe :</p>\r\n<blockquote>«Oui, mais les gens ne me croiront pas !» «Pour preuve, voici sur ta main, un signe de croix ineffaçable», répond l’apparition, qui ajoute : «D’ici un an, toi, tu ne seras plus de ce monde !»[1] </blockquote>\r\n<p>L'apparition a donné un signe. Elle a choisi le signe de la croix de Jésus. La croix de Jésus ouvre un passage : en s'unissant à Jésus, la mort (et la voyante mourra bientot) est un passage pour s'élever vers Dieu.   Des guérisons sont alléguées [1]. Les guérisons sont le signe le plus fréquent dans les Evangiles. Jésus donne sa vie pour donner la vie, la vie éternelle, et la vie dès cette terre.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Un petit oratoire est bâti, et, en 1852</li>\r\n    <li>La première statue est remplacée par un modèle en marbre blanc.

Ce genre &laquo; d&rsquo;esclavage &raquo; lib&egrave;re de l&rsquo;esclavage du p&eacute;ch&eacute; (lire saint Paul : Rm 6) et unit les c&oelig;urs &agrave; l&rsquo;Immacul&eacute;e. C&rsquo;est aussi une imitation de J&eacute;sus qui s&rsquo;est fait le serviteur, en particulier avant sa passion lorsqu&rsquo;il a lav&eacute; les pieds des disciples (Jn 13), et qui est mort -comme le dit le livre d&rsquo;Isa&iuml;e dans les chants du Serviteur (Is 42. 50. 53)-, &laquo; pour justifier les multitudes &raquo;.&nbsp;</p> <p class=\"noteDeArticle\"><em>(1) Cf.

Avec l&rsquo;accord de l&rsquo;empereur Alexandre S&eacute;v&egrave;re, il construisit le premier lieu de culte chr&eacute;tien officiellement ouvert au public.</p>\r\n<p class=\"retraitLigne\">La basilique fut reconstruite par Jules II en l&rsquo;an 337-353.</p>\r\n<p class=\"retraitLigne\">Le titre marial de la basilique date probablement de l&rsquo;&eacute;poque du concile d&rsquo;Eph&egrave;se (431).</p>\r\n<p class=\"retraitLigne\">Au Moyen Age, sous le pontificat de Innocent III (1130-1143), elle fut reconstruite et d&eacute;cor&eacute;e des mosa&iuml;ques magnifiques que nous admirons aujourd&rsquo;hui.</p>\r\n<p class=\"retraitLigne\">Au XVII&deg; si&egrave;cle, on fit le plafond &agrave; caissons.</p>\r\n<p class=\"noteDeArticle\">Domenico MARCUZZI, Santuari mariani d&rsquo;Italia, edizioni Paoline, Roma 1982, p.46</p>\r\n<p class=\"IntertitreDeArticle\">Un sanctuaire aujourd'hui bien vivant</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>La basilique est gard&eacute;e par le clerg&eacute; dioc&eacute;sain et par la communaut&eacute; sant&rsquo;Egidio ; une communaut&eacute; tr&egrave;s engag&eacute;e dans la rencontre entre les peuples, la fraternit&eacute;, le dialogue inter-religieux, la paix. La communaut&eacute; anime une pri&egrave;re des v&ecirc;pres tous les soirs (&agrave; 20h).</li>\r\n    <li>F&ecirc;te : le 1&deg; janvier</li>\r\n    <li>Acc&egrave;s : quartier du Trastevere.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"IntertitreDeArticle\">L&rsquo;abside de Sainte Marie de Trastevere</p>\r\n<p class=\"retraitLigne\">Vers la fin du X&deg; si&egrave;cle, au nord des Alpes, s&rsquo;&eacute;tait r&eacute;pandu un nouveau type de repr&eacute;sentations dans lequel, somptueusement couronn&eacute;e rev&ecirc;tue, l&rsquo;&Eacute;glise-&eacute;pouse si&eacute;geait sur le m&ecirc;me tr&ocirc;ne que le Christ &Eacute;poux, comme une imp&eacute;ratrice. Dans ces compositions, on reconnaissait que l&rsquo;&eacute;pouse &eacute;tait une personnification par sa position frontale et rigide, sa figure hi&eacute;ratique, et la fixit&eacute; de son expression.</p>\r\n<p class=\"retraitLigne\">La mosa&iuml;que absidale de S. Marie en Trastevere (Rome), fut ex&eacute;cut&eacute;e en 1140. Le Christ Seigneur s&rsquo;assied dans l&rsquo;axe de l&rsquo;abside sur un grand tr&ocirc;ne qu&rsquo;il partage avec l&rsquo;Epouse assise &agrave; sa droite; sur la verticale de la t&ecirc;te du Christ on aper&ccedil;oit la Main du P&egrave;re qui soutient la couronne pour lui. L&rsquo;Eglise Epouse, &agrave; la t&ecirc;te d&eacute;couverte, rev&ecirc;tue de la dalmatique imp&eacute;riale brod&eacute;e avec des pierres pr&eacute;cieuses, est impassible, le regard droit devant soi, elle partage le tr&ocirc;ne du Christ, (synthronos) ; cependant, ayant des proportions plus petites, elle occupe une place plus petite sur le tr&ocirc;ne, de sorte que le Christ est au centre de l&rsquo;abside. Le Christ Epoux exprime sa communion avec l&rsquo;Eglise par l&rsquo;&eacute;treinte de sa droite; l&rsquo;inscription sur son livre est une expression du Cantique (Ct 4,8) avec le premier verset du Psaume 110, traditionnellement attribu&eacute; au Christ : &ldquo;Veni electa mea et ponam in te thronum meum&rdquo;. L&rsquo;invitation du Psaume &agrave; s&rsquo;asseoir &agrave; la droite se transforme ainsi l&rsquo;invitation &agrave; partager le tr&ocirc;ne. La r&eacute;f&eacute;rence au geste du bras se fonde aussi sur le Cantique, texte que porte l&rsquo;Eglise Epouse : Sa gauche est sous ma t&ecirc;te et sa droite il m&rsquo;&eacute;treint&quot; (Ct 2,6).</p>\r\n<p class=\"retraitLigne\">L&rsquo;int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de cette mosa&iuml;que est li&eacute; &agrave; l&rsquo;identification de la figure f&eacute;minine: s&rsquo;agit-il de l&rsquo;Eglise Epouse ou aussi de la Vierge Marie &eacute;pouse ?</p>\r\n<p class=\"SecondIntertitre\">Pour les uns, c&rsquo;est seulement l&rsquo;&Eacute;glise :</p>\r\n<p>La datation de l&rsquo;&oelig;uvre, la rigidit&eacute; de la figure de l&rsquo;Ecclesia comme aussi le fait qu&rsquo;elle s&rsquo;assoie d&eacute;j&agrave; couronn&eacute;e aux c&ocirc;t&eacute;s du Christ, tout cela fait croire qu&rsquo;il s&rsquo;agit simplement de l&rsquo;Eglise Epouse, en particulier Gertrud Schiller &eacute;crit: &quot;[&hellip;] alors que le couronnement est la cons&eacute;quence de l&rsquo;Assomption de Marie au ciel, l&rsquo;Epouse Eglise est depuis le d&eacute;but d&eacute;j&agrave; couronn&eacute;e, c&rsquo;est pourquoi le geste du couronnement n&rsquo;est pas repr&eacute;sent&eacute;.&quot; D&rsquo;autre part, les cinq sc&egrave;nes relatives &agrave; la vie de Marie, (Naissance de Marie. Annonciation. Nativit&eacute; de Christ. &Eacute;piphanie, Pr&eacute;sentation au Temple, Assomption de la Vierge), dans l&rsquo;abside, sont post&eacute;rieures d&rsquo;un demi-si&egrave;cle &agrave; la mosa&iuml;que du centre de l&rsquo;abside, elles ne peuvent pas &ecirc;tre un argument pour lui donner une signification mariale &agrave; l&rsquo;origine.</p>\r\n<p class=\"SecondIntertitre\">Pour d&rsquo;autres, c&rsquo;est aussi Marie</p>\r\n<p>Le fait que la basilique de S. Marie en Trastevere ait &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;di&eacute;e tr&egrave;s anciennement &agrave; la Vierge Marie portent d&rsquo;autres sp&eacute;cialistes &agrave; croire qu&rsquo;il est au contraire tr&egrave;s probable que quand la mosa&iuml;que y fut ex&eacute;cut&eacute;e, l&rsquo;intention &eacute;tait d&eacute;j&agrave; de reconna&icirc;tre aussi la figure de Marie dans la figure de l&rsquo;Eglise -Epouse.

In the 18th century, to keep the Russians out of Alta, California, the Archbishop of Mexico sent a statue of Our Lady of Bethlehem for the new mission in California, to be the \"Conquistadora\" on behalf of the Spanish settlers. As the mission grew and prospered under her protection, this Virgin was highly venerated.</p> <p>In 1948 when the abandoned mission was restored the statue was returned to its first shrine.

Ce programme portait un nom : Notre Dame, modèle de l'Église. Marie est la médiatrice, la reine, la mère; on peut dire la même chose de l'Église.»[1]</p> <p>Il n’y a avait pas de chapelle dédiée à la vierge Marie, la cathédrale elle-même était la Vierge Marie. «A partir de leurs portails majestueux, les grandes cathédrales dédiées à la Bienheureuse Vierge proposent une catéchèse mariale de nature christocentrique: les fidèles passaient d'un monde extérieur à l'intimité de l'Église, de Notre Dame Marie, pour être formés, éduqués, conduits vers l'autel, à l'eucharistie, à l'union avec Dieu.» [2] Le centre de tout, c’est Jésus, mais dans ce lieu spirituel qu’est Marie.</p> <p>Françoise Breynaert <br /> [1] T.

        "description": "Feast Day: May 10 There once was a beautiful church in Constantinople dedicated to the Mother of God, which had been built in the fifth century by the holy Emper...or Leo the Great (January 20) in the Seven Towers district. Before becoming emperor, Leo was walking in a wooded area where he met a blind man who was thirsty and asked Leo to help him find water. Though he agreed to search for water, he was unable to find any. Suddenly, he heard a voice telling him that there was water nearby. He looked again, but still could not find the water. Then he heard the voice saying “Emperor Leo, go into the deepest part of the woods, and you will find water there. Take some of the cloudy water in your hands and give it to the blind man to drink.Then take the clay and put it on his eyes. Then you shall know who I am.” Leo obeyed these instructions, and the blind man regained his sight. Later, St Leo became emperor, just as the Theotokos had prophesied. Leo built a church over the site at his own expense, and the water continued to work miraculous cures. Therefore, it was called “The Life-Giving Spring.” After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the church was torn down by the Moslems, and the stones were used to build a mosque. Only a small chapel remained at the site of the church. Twenty-five steps led down into the chapel, which had a window in the roof to let the light in. The holy Spring was still there, surrounded by a railing. After the Greek Revolution in 1821, even this little chapel was destroyed and the Spring was buried under the rubble. Christians later obtained permission to rebuild the chapel, and work began in July of 1833. While workmen were clearing the ground, they uncovered the foundations of the earlier church. The Sultan allowed them to build not just a chapel, but a new and beautiful church on the foundations of the old one. Construction began on September 14, 1833, and was completed on December 30, 1834. Patriarch Constantine II consecrated the church on February 2, 1835, dedicating it to the Most Holy Theotokos. The Turks desecrated and destroyed the church again on September 6, 1955. A smaller church now stands on the site, and the waters of the Life-Giving Spring continue to work miracles. There is also a Life-Giving Spring Icon of the Most Holy Theotokos which is commemorated on April 4. KONTAKION Tone 8 O most favored by God, you confer on me the healing of your grace from your inexhaustible Spring. Therefore, since you gave birth incomprehensibly to the Word, I implore you to refresh me with the dew of your grace that I might cry to you: Hail, O Water of salvation.",

Suddenly he saw only the back of the head. The young man shuddered and asked the Holy Virgin to turn her head again.

It was absolutely identical to what she saw in a dream and that had spoken. She prayed fervently before the image of the Pieta and touched it. After a few hours, she recovered. The faithful sang a hymn of thanksgiving before the statue of the Madonna and Bishop Paul Széchany confirmed the miracle. Sümeg Marian became a place of worship for many pilgrims seeking the comfort of Our Lady of Sorrows.",

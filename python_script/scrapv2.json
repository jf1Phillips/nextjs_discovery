Also gave him a commission to erect a church to his glory where he was to be kept this column of marble. She bilocated, that is, she appeared in Spain while still living in Jerusalem (or Ephesus). The origin of the Cathedral of Zaragoza is built around the chapel of Santa Maria del Pilar.",

Years later, fearful for his soul, Theophilus repented and prayed to the Virgin for forgiveness. After forty days of fasting, the Virgin appeared to him and verbally chastised him. Theophilus begged forgiveness and Mary promised to intercede with God. He then fasted a further thirty days, at which time Mary appeared to him again, and granted him Absolution. However, Satan was unwilling to relinquish his hold over Theophilus, and it was a further three days before Theophilus awoke to find the damning contract on his chest. He then took the contract to the legitimate bishop and confessed all that he had done. The bishop burned the document, and Theophilus expired, out of sheer joy to be free from the burden of his contract.",

        "description": "Isaac fled to Italy from his native Syria to escape life under the Monophysite heretics who denied that Christ had two natures (divine and human). Upon arriving in Spoleto, he obtained permission to remain in one of the city’s churches after dark in order to pray in the quiet of the night. He continued thus in prayer for three days and nights until a sacristan of the church, jealous of his piety, accused him of hypocrisy, struck him, and drove him away. The ill-tempered sacristan then fell under demonic possession. St. Isaac had stretched himself upon the body of his assailant. \"Isaac is driving me out !\" exclaimed the evil spirit, thus disclosing to the inhabitants of Spoleto the identity of the stranger. It was only through Isaac’s prayers that the demon was finally expelled. The townsfolk, convinced that they had in their midst a very holy man, offered him presents and would have built him a monastery, but he refused all gifts and retired to a cave on Monte Luco to live as a hermit. In his solitude he experienced a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who instructed him to begin accepting followers to be trained in the religious life. Isaac subsequently established at Mount Luco a laura, a community of hermits, each living in his own cell, but regularly assembling for divine worship. He served as the community’s abbot. Saint Gregory the Great speaks of Isaac’s penchant for humor in sometimes yielding to “extreme joviality.” All that we know of St. Isaac is derived from the third book of the Dialogues of St. Gregory.",

        "description": "Feast Day: May 10 There once was a beautiful church in Constantinople dedicated to the Mother of God, which had been built in the fifth century by the holy Emper...or Leo the Great (January 20) in the Seven Towers district. Before becoming emperor, Leo was walking in a wooded area where he met a blind man who was thirsty and asked Leo to help him find water. Though he agreed to search for water, he was unable to find any. Suddenly, he heard a voice telling him that there was water nearby. He looked again, but still could not find the water. Then he heard the voice saying “Emperor Leo, go into the deepest part of the woods, and you will find water there. Take some of the cloudy water in your hands and give it to the blind man to drink.Then take the clay and put it on his eyes. Then you shall know who I am.” Leo obeyed these instructions, and the blind man regained his sight. Later, St Leo became emperor, just as the Theotokos had prophesied. Leo built a church over the site at his own expense, and the water continued to work miraculous cures. Therefore, it was called “The Life-Giving Spring.” After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the church was torn down by the Moslems, and the stones were used to build a mosque. Only a small chapel remained at the site of the church. Twenty-five steps led down into the chapel, which had a window in the roof to let the light in. The holy Spring was still there, surrounded by a railing. After the Greek Revolution in 1821, even this little chapel was destroyed and the Spring was buried under the rubble. Christians later obtained permission to rebuild the chapel, and work began in July of 1833. While workmen were clearing the ground, they uncovered the foundations of the earlier church. The Sultan allowed them to build not just a chapel, but a new and beautiful church on the foundations of the old one. Construction began on September 14, 1833, and was completed on December 30, 1834. Patriarch Constantine II consecrated the church on February 2, 1835, dedicating it to the Most Holy Theotokos. The Turks desecrated and destroyed the church again on September 6, 1955. A smaller church now stands on the site, and the waters of the Life-Giving Spring continue to work miracles. There is also a Life-Giving Spring Icon of the Most Holy Theotokos which is commemorated on April 4. KONTAKION Tone 8 O most favored by God, you confer on me the healing of your grace from your inexhaustible Spring. Therefore, since you gave birth incomprehensibly to the Word, I implore you to refresh me with the dew of your grace that I might cry to you: Hail, O Water of salvation.",

Two years later the bishop of Clermont retired permanently in the abbey of Manlieu, where he died in 710. According to some uplifting stories of the thirteenth century, St.. Bonet saw the Virgin in 684 or 700, while praying alone in a church dedicated to St Michael. Sausseret reprints the facts reported in the bottom of a letter: \"the guards closed the doors. St. Bonit, full of joy for a chance to give free rein to his mercy from that moment, lay prostrate on the floor of the bathroom of the temple with his tears. But as soon as he had been in this position, you feel suddenly come down from heaven and filled with the sounds of harmony. He saw, at the same time, all heavenly choirs fill the sacred area with this light and enter a multitude that his faith had blessed him with. There were, in fact, legions of angels and saints, who composed a the procession for their Queen, mother of Jesus Christ, who appeared after them, seated on a throne carried by seraphim and similar to a queen that a large honor guard precedes and accompanies [...] All these immortal beings continued along the main nave and when they came in front of 'main altar, some of them asked who among them would say the mass. Then the Blessed Virgin spoke up and said, 'Here Bonit, we seek you my faithful servant and excellent bishop, and worthy of fulfilling this holy function \" Some blessed then, obeying the order that she had just given detachment from others and went to the holy bishop who was trembling. Taken by the hand,he accompanied the choir. The saints clothed him in a pontifical ornaments and then he began to say mass with glorified beings as assistants [...] When Mass was over, the Holy Virgin, left him.>> (I, 118-120).

The legend of the animal \"Crucifer\" was adapted from John of Damascus in the seventh century, then taken up by Jacopo da Varazze, in his Golden Legend (1261-1266). Bibliography: P.

        "description": "In 934, St. Eberhard of Strasbourg, arrived and set about building a large monastery and Church, the latter enclosing and protecting the hermit and martyr Meinrad's holy little chapel, which was only eight and a half yards long by six yards wide. When this work was completed in the summer of 948, Eberhard, having become the first Abbot of Einsiedeln, invited St. Konrad, the Bishop of Konstanz, to consecrate and dedicate the Chapel of Our Lady of the Hermits. St. Konrad's party, which included the Bishop of Augsburg and many princes and knights of the German Empire, arrived at the hermitage in the Dark Wood, on the eve of the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. The holy Bishop of Konstanz retired to his room early in the evening in order to rest after the trip. However, despite his fatigue, he did not fail to get up, as was his custom, before midnight, and to go with several religious to pray in the chapel which he was due to consecrate the next morning. While he was fervently beseeching the Blessed Virgin to accept this holy shrine and to make it henceforth a center of pilgrimages where for centuries and centuries she would heal and help her suffering children, suddenly, at exactly midnight, St. Konrad and those with him began to hear the sound of many harmonious voices, chanting a melody of heavenly beauty. Looking up, he saw with amazement that the sanctuary of the chapel was filled with a brilliant light that made everything clearer than the brightest noonday sun, and that the altar was completely illuminated as for a solemn festival. Then he saw coming down from Heaven a magnificent procession of Angels under the leadership of St. Michael the Archangel. Some of them formed the choir and were chanting celestial psalms, while others bearing swinging golden censers took their places before the altar. After the angels came St. Peter, St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke, and St. John, St. Gregory, St. Augustine and St. Ambrose. Then came, vested as deacon and subdeacon, the Martyr-Saints Lawrence and Stephen. And finally, as High Priest, arrayed in pontifical vestments and wearing a violet chasuble, there appeared in all the splendor of His Divinity, Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Then, as a breathtaking climax, just before God the Son began the Mass that was to consecrate this holy shrine forever to His Immaculate Mother, Mary herself took her place above the altar of her chapel, radiant with dazzling glory and attended by her train of angelic spirits! In speechless awe, St. Konrad followed every detail of this extraordinary Mass. He observed with rapt attention that the solemn ceremony was performed in the minutest particulars according to the ritual prescribed by the Church for the consecration of a temple, except that, at the Sanctus, the angels sang: \"Holy God, have mercy on us in the court of the Glorious Virgin! Blessed be the Son of Mary Who has come to this place and Who is to reign for ages of ages!\" More than an hour later, having formally dedicated the shrine to His Blessed Mother under the title of Our Lady of the Hermits, the King of Kings returned in all His majesty to Heaven with His distinguished company of Saints and Angels. The beautiful living Virgin vanished too, leaving in her place the lovely statue. The singing ceased. The bright light was magically extinguished. And soon the newly consecrated shrine was, to all outward appearances, exactly as it had been before. The saintly Bishop of Konstanz, however, remained kneeling for hours in ecstatic meditation over the marvels which he had just witnessed. Later that morning, when all the dignitaries had assembled, and after he had kept them waiting quite a while, he was politely informed that it was time for him to begin the dedication ceremony. Still deeply moved, he firmly declared that the chapel had already been miraculously consecrated by God Himself during the night. But when the Abbot Eberhard and the other officials refused to accept this story, and insisted that the ceremony for which so many persons had come together should start at once, St. Konrad yielded. Then another striking supernatural intervention took place: as the Bishop put his foot on the first altar step, the great Church was suddenly filled with a strong and impressive voice which everyone present heard exclaim three times: \"Stop! Stop, Brother! This Chapel has been Divinely consecrated!\" Later on, a full investigation of these extraordinary events was undertaken by the highest civil and ecclesiastical authorities, and in the year 964, in the presence of the German Emperor Otto and of St. Konrad the Bishop, His Holiness Pope Leo VIII issued a bull confirming the miraculous dedication.",

        "description": "Santa Maria della Petrara is the mother church of the town of Castelnuovo di Conza in the province of Salerno in the region of Campania in southwest Italy.* It succeeded the Church of San Nicola around the tenth century. The site of present-day Castelnuovo dates back to antiquity. The name “Petrara” stems from an ancient village perched on a promontory with caverns and caves. The legend of Castelnuovo recounts that the Blessed Mother appeared to a Cantelnovese man or woman on the path and asked for a piece of ‘unfit’ bread. It is said the person went to his/her house and took a piece of leaven dough ‘smeared with oil or paste’ and offered it to the Madonna. It is said that the Lady asked that an image of her be placed in a church built on the spot. A statue was crafted depicting the Madonna with a piece of bread in her hand, a genuine product of the earth. So was born the image of Madonna delle Colture and the church of Santa Maria della Petrara, a title by which Our Lady is also known, as well as Maria della Petrara. The title is also quite popular in Syria where she is commemorated annually on January 15th. *Not far from Castelnuovo is the Benedictine monastery of St. Menna that plays prominently in the town’s early history. Castelnuovo was hit by the earthquake of January 14, 1466, and was at the epicenter of the earthquake of November 23, 1980.",

The Virgin was accompanied by two angels who held onto her head a triple crown. The count was hunting on the site in the evening when a great glow rose from a tree. Mary said: \"Do not fear, my son, because I am the Mother of God will find a statue of this tree will become a pledge of blessing to many. You'll place it in the church that you care to build here in my honor.\"",

Countless were the Christians sacrificed on the alter of Revolution, especially in Paris, where the tireless work of the guillotine filled the street gutters with rivers of human blood. Trouble had come to the countryside as well. Already at the beginning of the century, the greed of the secular landlord of Fontgombault had chased away all but five monks. By this time, at the end of the century, not a single monk was left to sing the Divine Praises. Theayor of the village of Fontgombault had begun to sell the very stones of the Abbey walls (July 2, 1791). But the work of destruction was not yet complete. It was about this time that an impious hand sought to destroy the statue of Mary above the northern door of the church. He positioned a ladder and climbed up in order to carry out the practice, quite common with the revolutionaries, of breaking off the head and members of a piece of art that offended him and the new ideas of those who had no more need of God and His Saints. As he swung his hammer, however, he suddenly lost his balance and fell off the ladder, hurting himself mortally when he hit the ground far below. As he lay dying, the poor man regretted in an instant the evil deed he had done and begged God, through the intercession of the Virgin Mother of God whom he had so gravely offended, to forgive him. Such was his change of heart, his conversion at the moment of death, that the witnesses recognized in the event a special grace from heaven. From that moment on the statue has been known as Our Lady of a Happy Death.",

When he came back to recuperate it, he would find a \"sign\" on the end of the handle. John ran quickly home to the farm and asked his brother and sister to go back and retrieve his spade. The youngsters found it \"standing straight up with three cross-shaped oak leaves coming out of the top of the handle.\" The four women made reparation for their wrongs and people went in procession to the place of the miracle. In early July, the Virgin appeared a second time to John, in his bedroom. \"You did what I asked you to do well, and the fountain will be good; the people have corrected themselves well,\" she told him. A commission of inquiry has identified twenty-eight cures from the water of the fountain. In October 1686, a second inquiry mentioned seven new cases. The chapel of Pla-Rouzaud was built by the poor villagers and blessed on September 8, 1695 by Monsignor de Verthamon. The renown of the shrine Our Lady of Celles spread widely and attracted believers from the entire region and even from Spain. The pilgrimage, which takes place to this day at the restored shrine on the third Sunday of July, is marked by evangelical simplicity and Marian humility.

Hoping at all costs to make them apostatize, he went so far as to send his remarkably beautiful daughter to seduce them. But while discussing the Gospel with the prisoners, believing she would defeat them, Ismenia was defeated. She asked the knights to carve the image of Mary for her. The knights prayed to the Blessed Virgin so that she would guide their hands. During the night, the Virgin sent angels bearing her radiant image of piety. The next day, when Ismenia returned the dungeon was filled with dazzling light and a delicious perfume exuded from the statue. The princess believed immediately and took the statue to her apartments, never taking her eyes off the statue while the knights cried out: Our Lady of Liesse! The following night, Ismenia heard the statue say: \"Trust me, Ismenia! I have prayed to my Son for you. You will be his faithful servant. You will free my three beloved knights. You will be baptized and through you, France will be enriched by countless graces. Through you my name will become famous and later, I will receive you forever in paradise.\" Ismenia helped the prisoners escape and fled with them. All four of them were overtaken by a deep sleep, and during their sleep angels transported them to France. When they awoke, the three knights were in their country, near their castle in Marchais. Ismenia was baptized and they all agreed to have a chapel built at the site where they had woken up, in honor of Our Lady of Liesse. Since then miracles have been countless. Louis VII came as a pilgrim in 1146 and Our Lady of Liesse became a favorite pilgrimage destination of the kings of France.",

In 1116 she became a nun there and twenty years later she was made the head of the monastery. From her early childhood Hildegard had visions, but soon realized she was unique in this ability and hid the gift for many years. However, in 1141, she had a series of visions in which God gave her instant understanding of the meaning of the religious texts. God commanded Hildegard to write down everything she observed in the visions and she devoted the next ten years doing this (including 26 drawings of things she had seen during the visions). In a vision, Hildegard saw the universe as a cosmic egg surrounded by flames, which represents God burning everywhere. In the center is air full of water, giving moisture to the entire egg. In the globe, a mountain divides darkness from light. When experiencing a vision, Hildegard would see a bright light - more brilliant than a cloud over the sun - inside which an even brighter light which she called \"the living light\" sometimes appeared. But she didnt see the visions with her bodily eyes, which remained open, but in her soul. She also claimed to hear words, spoken in Latin. As news of her visions began to spread and gain fame, Pope Eugenius III decided to sent a commission to inquire into her work. This commission found her teaching orthodox and her insights authentic, and reported so to the Pope, who sent her a letter of approval. Hildegard of Bingen has been called one of the most important figures in the history of the Middle Ages and was a woman of many extraordinary and diverse talents. Besides being the abbess of a large and influential Benedictine abbey, she was a prominent preacher, healer, scientist, and artist as well as a composer and theologian, writing nine books on theology, medicine, science, and physiology, as well as 70 poems and an opera. During a time when few women were accorded respect, Hildegard was consulted by and advised bishops, popes and kings, and spoke out openly against corruption in the church. She was made a Doctor of the Church by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012.Source: Livingmiracles.net",

Digging deeper they uncovered a bronze bell.

The first night they rested at a certain village, where Abbot John had the following vision in a dream. It seemed to him that he was in the monastery at Byland when he saw a Lady, nobly dressed, and of surpassing beauty, holding by Her left hand a little Boy, who plucked a bough from a little tree that stood in the center of the cloister quadrangle, and then they both vanished. After this the abbot and monks set forth, but not knowing their way, the abbot proposed that they should recite their Office. Having done so, the Lady and Her Son re-appeared, and the abbot begged Her to lead them to Joreval. Then looking at Her Son, She said, \"Sweetest Son, for the love Thou hast ever had for Me, be a guide to these brethren.\" Then the Child held out the branch He had picked from the cloister of Byland, and said, \"Follow Me,\" and they did so, walking through rough and hard ways without any difficulty. And a number of little birds, snowy white, flew down on to the bough the Child held, and there sang the hymn, Benedicite omnia opera Domini Domino, whereby they were much refreshed, and at last they reached a wild uncultivated spot, where the Child planted His branch in the earth with the birds singing upon it, and said, \"Here God will soon be invoked and adored.\" And it seemed as though the whole land grew into a great tree covered with white singing birds. Then the Child disappeared. Abbot John then awoke, and with his companions proceeded on his journey much consoled. The monks were all clothed in white, and everyone asked, \"Who are all these men in white going by?\" Then Abbot John heard one reply: \"They are monks moving from Byland to Joreval.\" Another gazed at the firmament and stars for a while, and then, as if he had received a revelation, said, \"These good monks have come at a happy moment; they will, within a brief space, attain to much prosperity, and have abundance of all things necessary.\" Abbot John was much rejoiced at these words and proceeded on his way. This legend was known to everyone in those parts and often retold.",

She was never formally canonized, but in 1584 her name was entered in the Roman Martyrology and has remained there. Given to works of piety from her youth, much afflicted with bodily and mental suffering, a zealous observer of the Rule of St. Benedict and of the regulation of her convent, and devoted to practices of mortification, Elizabeth was favoured, from 1152, with ecstasies and visions of various kinds. These generally occurred on Sundays and Holy Days at Mass or Divine Office or after hearing or reading the lives of saints. Christ, His Blessed Mother, an angel, or the special saint of the day would appear to her and instruct her; or she would see quite realistic representations of the Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension, or other scenes of the Old and New Testaments. What she saw and heard she put down on wax tablets. Her abbot, Hildelin, told her to relate these things to her brother Egbert (Eckebert), then priest at the church of Bonn. At first she hesitated fearing lest she be deceived or be looked upon as a deceiver; but she obeyed. Egbert (who became a monk of Schönau in 1155 and succeeded Hildelin as second abbot) put everything in writing, later arranged the material at leisure, and then published all under his sister's name.",

In 1157, a Benedictine monk named Magnus, taking a small statue of the Madonna and Child, retired into the wilderness, where tradition says the dense trees parted to make way for him. A little chapel was built around a linden tree, the origin of the shrine. Pilgrims as far back as the 15th century attest they have seen the Madonna’s face, eyes and lips moving, as if she were alive. The present structure was erected in the 17th century. The middle spire of the Church is of Gothic design, while the outer spires are Baroque. Many of the pilgrims to Maria Zell perform the same penance up the main stairway.

        "description": "A poor carpenter of Le Puy, named Durand, claimed to have had an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In this vision he received a paper on which there was a representation of the Blessed Virgin seated on a throne with a figure of the child Jesus in her hands, and bearing the inscription, \"Lamb of God who takest away the sins of the world give us peace\". An association was to be formed whose members should bind themselves to keep and procure peace and, as distinctive signs, wear a white hood and a medal bearing a reproduction of the picture and inscription. Durand met with astounding success in the execution of these instructions. A confraternity was organized under the direction of the clergy exactly on the lines of Catholic confraternities of the present day. The Church of Our, Lady of Le Puy became the center of the movement, which spread with extraordinary rapidity over the provinces of France, south of the Loire. The Capuciati, in addition to pledging themselves not to swear falsely, not to blaspheme, not to play dice, enter taverns, or wear costly garments, also promised to do all in their power to restore and maintain peace. Their endeavors in this line were not ineffectual, an overwhelming defeat which the \"Routiers\", or undisciplined bands of soldiery of the period, sustained in 1183 must be largely ascribed to the cooperation of the Capuciati with the royal army. The existence of the confraternity was of short duration. Its disappearance is involved in obscurity; but it seems to have directed its efforts against the members of the nobility, and to have been wiped out of existence by them, aided by the \"Routiers\". Its advocacy of heretical principles is not clearly and trustworthily indicated in historical records. The accusation that it respected neither ecclesiastical nor civil authority may perhaps be explained by its resistance to real or imagined abuses of power.",

The first phrase, taken from Psalm 107:2 —Paratum cor meum Deus paratum cor meum— “My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready” is the perfect act of preparation for Holy Communion. The second phrase is Our Blessed Lady’s own acquiescence to the mystery of the Incarnation as recorded in Luke 1:30 —Fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum— “Be it done to me according to thy word”. Receiving her very own words from the lips of her servant Silvester, the Mother of God gave him Holy Communion. Claudio Ridolfi painted the episode in 1632. More on this apparition >>",

The church became the center of the Porziuncola of the Franciscan Order, which was later confirmed by Pope Innocent III in the same year and in 1212 Order of Poor Clares was established. St. Francis received the gift of the Sacred Stigmata in 1224 and died there in 1226. The indulgence of the Porziuncola (full remission of sin and markets receiving the sacrament of penance) illustrates the influence of this grace in this place for centuries. Orders Franciscans (as well: Poor Clares, Capuchins, minorities) have been especially dedicated to the Marian devotion evenl today. Francis was canonized in 1228. The commitment of the Franciscans through the centuries to defend the Immaculate Conception, which contributed so much to its solemn dogmatic proclamation of this mystery in 1854, is one of the most distinctive features of their way to relive the experience of the Poor Man of Assisi.

Since then became known as a fervent preacher in northern Italy. Anthony was canonized by Pope Gregory IX in the cathedral of Spoleto May 30, 1232.

His heavenly visitors encouraged him in his prayers and chided him when he fell into any fault. His mother, though only a poor widow, sent him to school, feeling sure that he would one day be a Saint. At the age of twenty, he left his home in Apulia to live in a mountain solitude. Here he passed three years, assaulted by the evil spirits and beset with temptations of the flesh, but consoled by the visits of Angels. After this his seclusion was invaded by disciples who refused to be sent away; and the rule of life which he gave them formed the foundation of the Celestines, a branch of the Order of Saint Benedict. Angels assisted in the church which Peter built; unseen bells rang peals of surpassing sweetness, and heavenly music filled the sanctuary when he offered the Holy Sacrifice; he had consented to be ordained, to find in the Holy Eucharist assistance against temptation. Suddenly the poor anchorite found himself torn from his loved solitude, having been named by acclamation to the Papal throne, which had remained vacant for twenty-seven months. Resistance was of no avail. He took the name of Celestine, to remind him of the heaven he was leaving and for which he sighed. He was seventy-two years old. After a reign of five months, Peter judged himself unfit for the office, and summoning the cardinals to his presence, he solemnly resigned his trust. During the remaining three years of his life he worked many and great miracles. On the day after his abdication, his blessing after Mass healed a lame man. Saint Peter left the palace, desiring seclusion, but was brought back by the papal guards, for his successor feared a schism; crowds had followed Saint Peter. Lest he be prevailed upon to take back his office, he was put under surveillance at Anagni. Content, he remarked: \"I desired nothing but a cell, and a cell they have given me.\" And there he enjoyed his former loving intimacy with the Saints and Angels, and sang the Divine praises almost continually. At length, on Pentecost Sunday he told his guards he would die within the week, and immediately fell ill. He received the Last Sacraments, and the following Saturday, as he finished the concluding verse of Lauds, \"Let every spirit bless the Lord!\" he closed his eyes to this world and opened them to the vision of God.

The Blessed Virgin appeared to her and reassured her, saying: \"Yes, I will!

She became the superior of the convent school. Her contemplation and devotion was closely tied to the liturgy. Gertrude the Great noted, the last seven years of life of Matilda, the gifts of His grace interiors (Liber specialis gratiae).

But with the passage of time, seeing that the city stronglyy resisted, he decided to go to the very strong castles. On August 6, 1282, the French attempted to storm the fortress of San Salvatore but the young gallant charge of the defense of the walls heroically repulsed the 'attack causing heavy losses among the French soldiers. The people of Messina knew that the enemy was stronger and better organized, and more than that in the forces of their weapons relied mostly to prayer, asking for help to the Blessed Virgin (still in the prayers of Messina often used the phrase \"OH MOTHER QUEEN OF THE LETTER MESSINA SAVE, SAVE MESSINA \"). The 'August 8 unleashed a violent storm of Messina, water and hail fell as they could, the men and women took refuge in their homes, leaving the walls of the city defenseless, the enemy took advantage of immediately approaching the hill capperina unleashing a devastating attack. The commander of troops of Messina, Alaimo Leontini, realizing the danger in time, sounded the alarm at the cost of many victims the danger was gone. But the people of Messina were now to the strong forces, given that victims were numerous and food were scarce. The French knew well and that night again went on the attack, but there were two women guards Dina and Clarenza (whose statues are reproduced in movement in the bell tower of the cathedral), and while Dina threw stones at the French military, was Clarenza in town to ring the bells as a sign of alarm. The battle was tough but the people of Messina were not alone to fight, during the fight, made an imposing appearance of the White Lady at whom the French were unable to look, was seen at key points in the battle to hang on the walls of the white veils that became resistant , and departed unseen archers arrows hitting the troops of Charles D 'Anjou, who seized with fear beat a retreat. That mysterious White Lady who threw darts and defended the walls with white veils, was none other than the Madonna, who had run to help her people. The White Lady made her second appearance on November 21, 1301, again defending the walls of Messina, and could be seen by everyone because it was broad daylight. A French soldier attemped to hurl an arrow against her but hitting the dart came back in a eye. After this new appearance, the French were frightened, took off the 'siege and left the city.

So it was, June 12, 1294, the hill was full of people and notables of Messina, and it had the appearance of a white dove marked out the air (this story is represented by statues in motion in the bell tower of the cathedral).

Another miracle that increases the fame of the sanctuary took place August 30, 1823. Some local workers had to drink to quench their thirst under the hot sun, but the drink did not decrease despite continued drinking. On September 7th,1901, the local bishop solemnly crowned the miraculous icon.",

        "description": "The Sanctuary of the Madonna of Rescue stands isolated on the high plain between Monte Ercole and the town of Sant'Agata in central Italy, about 25 miles from the Adriatic Sea. Local tradition holds that an earlier chapel there marked the place where the Virgin helped defeat an invading army. Perhaps the simple Romanesque style of the present church, built around 1520, reflects that of the former chapel. At that time, devotion to the Madonna del Soccorso had spread from Sicily throughout Italy. The Sanctuary's altarpiece depicts a story that took place in Palermo in 1306, although local tradition has moved the apparition to a site near this chapel. A young mother, impatient with her child, cries, \"To the devil with you!\" A demon appears and threatens the boy, but a radiant woman saves him. The mother and child give thanks in church, where they recognize the radiant woman in a fresco of the Madonna. The original painting was stolen in the 1970s; the present image is a copy commissioned from local artist Alpico Prosperi. Another miracle story, unique to Sant'Agata, involved a woman who invoked the Madonna del Soccorso when her jealous lover shot her in the breast. The unharmed woman's velvet corset with the bullet hole is on display in the chapel. The shrine became a regional place of pilgrimage, especially by fishermen thankful for Our Lady's help at sea. Her annual festa on the Sunday before Assumption Day now includes a Blessing of Automobiles.

The saint in 1316 married the noble lawyer Ulf Guidmarsson and had eight children with him, including the future St. Catherine of Sweden. For her religious devotion and her charity, Bridget soon became highly esteemed. After a journey of pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela (Spain), her husband retired to a Cistercian monastery and died there a year later (1344). This meant a turning point in the life of Bridget: She settled in and received revelations from Jesus Christ and the Holy Virgin Mary there. During this period of contemplation, Bridget became a mystical bride of Christ. Through a revelation, she was ordered to found a new religious order. In fact in 1346, through the work of Bridget, the monastery of the Brigidine Order. After a period of strict penance and prayer, she went to Rome in 1349 to obtain the approval of the Order religious and attend the jubilee proclaimed in 1350. She stayed for the remaining twenty-three years of her life in Italy. In 1370, the pope gave Bridget ot approval to establish the monastic order of the Holy.Savior, which later became (1379) the Order of Saint Bridget (Brigidine), with monks and nuns. In 1372/73, she undertook a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The saint is considered among the greatest and the most mystical of medieval women, and was canonized by Pope Boniface IX in 1391. Among the many writings that Bridget has left us, her greatest is a praise of the virtue and the life of the Virgin Mary.",

        "description": "Born in Florence, 1200; died 17 February, 1310, at Mount Senario, near Florence. He was the son of Bernard Falconieri, a merchant prince of Florence, and one of the leaders of the Republic. His family belonged to the Guelph party, and opposed the Imperialists whenever they could consistently with their political principles. Alexis grew up in the practice of the most profound humility. He joined the Laudesi, a pious confraternity of the Blessed Virgin, and there met the six future companions of his life of sanctity. He was favoured with an apparition of the Mother of God, 15 August, 1233, as were these companions. The seven soon afterwards founded the Order of the Servites. With consistent loyalty and heroism Alexis at one abandoned all, and retired to La Camarzia, a house on the outskirts of the town, and the following year to Mt. Senario. With characteristic humility, he traversed, as a mendicant, in quest of alms for his brethren, the streets of the city through which he had lately moved as a prominent citizen. So deep and sincere was him humility that, though he lived to the great age of hundred and ten years, he always refused to enter the priesthood, of which he deemed himself unworthy. The duties of our Saint were confined principally to the material needs of the various communities in which he lived. In 1252 the new church at Cafaggio, on the outskirts of Florence, was completed under his care, with the financial assistance of Chiarissimo Falconieri. The miraculous image of the Annunciation, still highly venerated in Italy, had its origin here. St. Juliana Falconieri, his niece, was trained in sanctity under his personal direction. The influence exerted on his countrymen by Alexis and his companions may be gathered from the fact that in a few years ten thousand persons had enrolled themselves under the banner of the Blessed Virgin in the Servite Order. At his death he was visited by the Infant Jesus in visible form, as was attested by eye-witnesses. His body rests near the church of the Annunciation, in Florence. Clement XI declared Alexis worthy of the veneration of the faithful, 1 December, 1717, and accorded the same honour to his six companions, 3 July 1725.",

At a time when scholars believed that no colloquial tongue could ever replace Latin as a gentleman's language, Jordan worked to make Italian the beautiful tongue that it is today. That's not the reason he was beatified by the Church but it's interesting and sometimes overlooked. Jordan attended the University of Paris where he first encountered the Dominican friars in 1276. Four years later, probably after obtaining his degrees, he returned to Italy and took the habit. He began a long teaching career there as soon as he was qualified to do so. Because of the excellence of his preaching in Florence, Jordan was appointed first lector there in 1305. He seems to have been fascinated with the whole question of preaching as an apostolic tool, and to have been one of the first to make a scientific study of it. He pointed out that the Greek church was \"invaded by a multitude of errors,\" because the Greeks had no preachers; he could never say enough in praise of Saint Dominic's farsightedness in establishing an order specifically for preaching. Jordan studied methods of making sermons more effective, both by using examples that would reach the people, and by the use of the vernacular. This latter was a much-disputed subject in his day (they had Dan Amon's then, too); Jordan was considered a daring innovator. Because it was controversial, he strove to make Italian a beautiful instrument on which he could play the melodies of the Lord. Blessed with an extraordinary memory, Jordan is supposed to have known the breviary by heart, as well as the missal, most of the Bible (with its marginal commentary), plus the second part of the Summa. This faculty of memory he used in his sermons, but he was quick to point out to young preachers that learning alone can never make a preacher. By the holiness of his own life he made this plain, and continually preached it to those he was training to preach. Jordan of Pisa had two great devotions--to Our Blessed Mother and to Saint Dominic. Once he was favored with a vision of Our Lady; she came into the fathers' refectory and served at table. Jordan, who was the only one who could see her, could barely eat for excitement. He spoke often of her in his sermons, and also of Saint Dominic. He founded a number of confraternities in Pisa, one of which has lasted until now. Jordan died on his way to Paris to teach at Saint Jacques. His body was returned from Piacenza, where death overtook him, to rest in the church at Pisa (Benedictines, Dorcy).",

Two rough soldiers, from a band of mercenaries, were lying in wait. Egidia Mathis (that was the lady's name), seeing that she was going to be attacked by men who intended to rape her despite her condition, clung on desperately to the image of the Madonna painted on the column, calling for her help. Without warning, a beam of light flashed from the image, blinding the two mercenaries who fled in a panic. Then, the Madonna herself appeared to Egidia comforted her for several minutes and assured her that the danger over. Then Our Lady vanished. Due to such feelings of fear and emotion, Egidia gave birth at the foot of the column. With her new-born child wrapped in her shawl, the young mother managed to reach the nearest house. The news of the awful incident spread like wildfire all around town: although it was late, crowds flocked to the place where the attempted attack and the apparition of the Virgin had taken place. There, an extraordinary sight greeted them: the column was surrounded with thick blackthorn bushes which were unexpectedly covered in white flowers despite the harsh late December weather. Since this time, the bushes flower yearly over the same period of days.",

Because of his physical condition, he wavered but was told not to worry. He struggled to fulfill his mission, and when he reached the top he stopped to gather his strength. It was at that point that he felt a strange tingling in his leg. He rose as a new person and ran to tell his parents carrying the crutch he no longer needed. There are many wondrous stories of Our Lady of Montenero and many miraculous events attributed to her. Tradition also says that it was through her intercession that the city was saved from the devastation of an earthquake on January 27, 1472. Then there was the miraculous wind that saved the city from invasion launched by Emperor Maximilian I in 1496 and her deliverance of the city from a plague in 1720. In thanksgiving for the latter, all the Leghorn Bills of Health down through the year 1859 bore the image of the Madonna of Montenero. She is also credited with saving St. Paul of the Cross, founder of the Passionists, whose ship was floundering off the coast as he made his way to Pisa in 1750. The shrine of Our Lady atop the mountain looking down on Leghorn is a very popular pilgrimage destination. Especially attracted to the shine are young, unmarried women who, on the eves of Marian feast days, cast garlands of flowers before her solitarily unique and engrossing image. The painting depicts the Blessed Mother seated with the Jesus on her left knee. A small bird rests on her right forearm singing. (Also see the title Virgin with Garland.)",

Louis, feeling lost in front of the imminent danger, turned to a portrait of the Madonna and prayed constantly to help his kingdom, then suddenly fell into a deep sleep where he dreamed that Mary took the portrait from the table and placed it on his chest. Upon awakening, Louis, finding himself with the image of Mary on his chest, realized that the dream was to reality. Also in this dream, the Blessed Virgin had made a recommendation to erect a chapel in her devotion in Styria (Austria). Inspired by this vision, King Louis fought strongly and fearlessly against the mighty Tartar army. It reported a wonderful and incredible victory, then attributed the miraculous intervention of Madonna. In gratitude for the narrow escape, Louis went on pilgrimage among Styrian mountains to fulfill a vow. Next to an old church, where a statue of Mary was venerated, he built an exquisite chapel to Mary. The church was built in ancient Roman style in 1200 by King Henry Vladislav of Moravia in gratitude for healing from a serious illness; it was placed inside the Our Lady of linden wood carved by Magnus Monaco. From building the chapel, gift of King Louis, \"Mary Help of Christians (Mariazell Styria) before invoked as \"Mother of the Slav peoples,\" was considered by Hungarian as their sanctuary and became a national goal of imposing pilgrimages. To commemorate this most memorable victory, King Louis erected right on the spot where the Mother of God appeared to him in Slovakia the church of \"Mary Help of Christians.\" This church contains a copy of the statue of Mariazell.

Our Lady was seated in a circle of light in the church constructed in her name. An army of angels with their censers surrounded them. Both Christians and pagans saw this, recounted in the chronicle of the monastery. According to the accounts of the geographer and Muslim chronicler Al-Maqrizi (1364-1442), the Virgin also appeared each year in the church of the Al-Maghti monastery, known by the Ethiopians by the name of Dabra Metmaq, located close to Lake Bouroullos and north of Bilqas in the Eastern Delta, the 21st day of the Coptic month Bachnas (May 29th), when large crowd, coming from all Egypt, gathered in this place for a pilgrimage as important as that of the church of the Resurrection in Jerusalem. According to Marian tradition preserved in Ethiopia, following the Christ Child's explicit prayer, formulated during the flight of the Holy Family to Egypt, the Virgin appeared annually to faithful pilgrims, who ardently desired to see her from the bottom of their hearts, at Al-Maghti at the time of the pilgrimage which took place during the Coptic month of Bachnas (at the end of May), with the archangels Michael and Gabriel, as well as holy martyrs.

The shepherd girl noticed that her tongue had become loose and she answered that she would ask her father's permission. And she did so. When she found him, he was surprised to see his daughter speaking. He believed in the veracity of the apparition and told his daughter that he would give not only the sheep but anything that Lady asked for. Happy as a lark the shepherd girl ran to the place where she had seen the Lady, who asked her to build a chapel in her honor. But like the story of the Virgin of the Ferns the story does not end here. When the father arrived at the place he found a simple image of the Virgin among the poison ivy. \"It was here that the Mother of God wanted her chapel built\". But the good father that that place was not a good one for the building of a chapel. \"Our Lady certainly would not mind if the place was on a hill or in a sheltered valley: it would be even better for her and for the faithful. So much wind up there...\" So he picked up the image and went home. He called his carpenter friends and chose a good place at Casal de Santa Maria. And he left the image in a temporary niche. But, on the following day the image was gone. \"Who had been the rascal\"? They looked everywhere and found that the image had returned to its place, wild and windy, in the middle of the poison ivy.",

The river then ran a few yards away from where the girl was, a place studded with bushes of hawthorn. Suddenly a ball of light appeared. The Blessed Virgin Mary entrusts the girl with a mission: \" Here at Garlasco I want a sanctuary to protect the whole Lomellina. Many are the graces that I pour into this place and my children will experience the treasures of my mercy.\" Maria returned to Garlasco and neighbors heard the child's mouth, no longer deaf and dumb, at once believed the Our Lady's message of the apparition. From that moment the girl called Maria was blessed by Mary with the miracle that Our Lady had made on her. The pastor of Garlasco took care of her, who retired to the convent, run by nuns and located on the western boundary of the territory of Garlasco Tromello between Alagna and near the river Terdoppio. The miraculous event gave way the building of the sanctuary. The building was erected in its present form, in four building campaigns that winds through the centuries.

Often Mary appeared to him to exhort us to pray and preach the Rosary. He led the Brotherhood of palm kernel and led a life devoted. He died on the anniversary of the birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1475 in Zwolle. Alan de Rupe wrote the Psalms of Mary (or The Rosary also) that belonged to the prayer of obligation Marian-inspired religious communities. The Psalms included 15 Our Fathers, 150 Hail Marys and 150 contemplations. One day, in a Dominican church in Paris, during the All Saints' Day octave, Bl. Alain de la Roche reproached himself for the lukewarm way he was reciting his rosary. Suddenly, Our Lady, accompanied by other virgins appeared before him and said, \"Do not flee, my son! If you don't believe who my companions and I are, just make the sign of the cross before us. If we are hellish visions, we will disappear immediately. If, on the contrary, we are heavenly visions, we will remain, and the light that emanates from each one of us will brighten.\" Alain made the sign of the cross and the light of the apparition grew brighter. \"O my son, doubt no more! I am your virginal bride,\" Our Lady told him. \"I have always loved you and I am concerned about you always. But you must know that nobody is without pain in this world; neither me, nor my Son, nor any of these saints have lived without suffering. What is more, you must keep the faith and patience as your weapons and prepare yourself for trials more difficult than those which you have experienced up to now. I have chosen you to fight like a brave man and a hero under the flag of Jesus Christ, not like a parody of a soldier! You will stand next to me under my banner. As for the moments of spiritual desert that you have experienced these past few days, don't let them worry you anymore. I wanted you to take that test. Accept it now as a penance and punishment for your past sins. Accept it also as a means of making progress in patience and for the salvations of others, both dead and alive.\" This is how Blessed Alain de la Roche described the apparition that sent him out into the world to preach: Her beauty seemed to reach the summits of what is possible; and, before such beauty, the beauty of flowers, even the beauty of the stars are only a pale copy, a formless shadow, a coarse outline. There exuded from the depths of her physical presence a sweet, powerful and intoxicating perfume. The accent of her voice and her words were so charming-nothing in this world can come close to comparing to her beauty.\"",

Curious tries in vain to climb up the steep rock, but can not. The next day returns with a long ladder and a good ax to clean the brambles and bushes, and introduces the hole mate Dattilo with a lantern that can see a beautiful and spacious cave. The next night, however, while sleeping, Gabriel sees in a dream the Virgin Mary, who tells him: \"Gabriel, leaving to others the care of the goats; edificami a chapel in the cave, and I'll always be your advocate.\" The next morning Gabriel was perplexed about what to do, it is a simple dream, but decided to personally inspect the cave. This is convenient, even if wet, to build a chapel. Do not spend many days, while grazing his flock and he is intent to weave wicker, sees a mysterious light in the cave and at the same time feels the same words that Our Lady had told him in a dream. Stunned by this clear and categorical command, decides to leave the herd, wearing a coarse habit, and start a new life, calling themselves Fra 'Gabriel. Then obtained the permission of the Abbot of the Benedictine Santa Maria de Olearia in Maiori, under whose spiritual jurisdiction is the territory, he builds an altar in the cave of the miracle dedicating it to the Blessed Virgin under the title of \"advocate.\" The news of the miraculous event spreads like wildfire and soon, with the help of the people, is built at the top of the rock church with a bell tower and a few rooms for the convenience of pilgrims. These rooms were enlarged in 1508 and increased by the same Fra 'Gabriel, to satisfy the desire of seven of his fellow countrymen who want to give themselves to him as a hermit's life. This is the first group of many hermits who honor the Virgin until 1687, that is, until the coming of the Camaldolese of Monte Corona, who built a hermitage regular. The Camaldolese decorate the church with marble and precious furnishings, September 8, 1720 the church was consecrated and dedicated to SS. dell'Avvocata by the Bishop of Ravello and Scala, Bishop Warrior. In memory of the work of expansion and embellishment made by the Fathers Camaldolesi is placed on the center door a plaque that still today can be read in Latin. It recalls the discovery of the cave by means of a dove, and the construction of the primitive church in honor of B. Virgin Advocate, by Gabriel Cinnamo in 1475, enlarged and embellished by the children of St. Romuald in 1719.",

According to hagiographic tradition, the Virgin encourages her to found the order of the Annonciades, approved by a canonical bull instituted by Pope Alexander VI on February 12, 1502. Messages * evoke the Franciscan and Marian dimension of the Annonciade: \"By the wounds of my Son, you will have the Mother\" (Chronicle of the Annunciation, 77; Drèze, 159, 162, 275, n ° 187 and H. Jacobs, \"The spiritual intuition of Jeanne de Valois\", in D. Dinet, 85). Historians of spirituality have retained his devotion to the hearts of Jesus and Mary. The hagiographic tradition of the classical age relates the following facts: \"Jesus Christ and the Virgin presented her with two hearts on a platter, Jesus Christ smilingly telling her also put hers there. But the Blessed One was greatly astonished that, having sought it, she perceived that she had none, because it was more perfectly united to that of Jesus than to her own body. \"(Chronicle of the Annonciade, 183-184, quoted by S. Martin, The Lives of the Saints, which are served in the course of the year ..., t. I, Paris, Edme Couterot, 1696, 486; by Giard, 86 and Philippe Loupès, in D. Dinet, 12).

The legend reads: \"On August 15, circa 1484, as they strolled along the banks Friars of The Lump, a boat manned by three sailors stood by the friars. They got off the boat along with a wooden box and begged the friars to be kept in the convent until the time they could come back for her. They accepted this task, and for some years was kept under the protection of the monastery, until one day a monk of the Third Order of St. Francis asked to open the box in the presence of all the brothers. After being favorably resolved your request, opened the box and showed the Sacred Image, and at that moment all exclaimed at once: Oh, Bella!'s Like heaven! After this event, they decided to place it on the altar of his church. When the news spread throughout the region, the faithful flocked to stare at the image and, in turn, gave alms for the construction of the convent, which at the time the works were paralyzed. Since that event he was enshrined Nstra title. Ms. de la Bella ... » The image remained in the convent until 1835, when it was moved to the Church of Santo Domingo de Guzman in Lepe. The Chronicles tells us so: \"In the year 1835, Mendizabal decreed by Royal Order of the Ministry of Grace and Justice of July 25, the secularization of some convents. Entering them the Convent of Our Lady of Beauty, superiors decided to move to the nearby Monastery of La Rabida taking with them their belongings image. On August 7 came a boat on the shores of El Terron for such rushed. Upon learning this fact Brother Joseph, chaplain of the convent and well known in Lepe for this, decided to warn the residents of this town in middle of the night, calling door to door to tell them what was going to happen. They all excited, followed the monk to the monastery. the monk opened the door of the chapel and shouted Viva la Virgen de la Bella!. The people who were, took the picture with her hands and took her running and almost in a twinkling, fearing that followed. Arriving at dawn to the Cross First, where were calmer. Finally, they took her to the church, entering triumphantly. \" Since that time the image remains on the town.",

She could not gather them together and crying, she exclaimed: \"God help me, help me with your light, Virgin Mary\", when it was dark. In the act he heard angel songs and saw the Virgin arrive with the Child in his arms and ordered her to go down to Aniezo and tell the priest to go up and send the brush that covered the entrance of a cave to clean, where he would find an image the one that should dedicate a sanctuary, to receive the people special graces. She abandoned the sheep and went down to the village. They say that the devil presented her in a pilgrim's outfit and tried to hinder her, but she entrusted herself to the Virgin and the enemy disappeared. Upon reaching the town, the priest did not believe her, and the girl returned. The Virgin imposed the sign of the cross to chase away the demon and sent it back to Aniezo. The priest, seeing her, went up with several neighbors at dawn and found the cave. They took her to the parish and the construction of the hermitage began, where the shepherdess remained as caretaker or blessed of the sanctuary. The image was canonically crowned by the Bishop of Santander on May 2, 1991. Pop John XXIII named her patron saint of Liébana in 1960. It has great devotion not only in Liébana but also in Polaciones, Nansa Valley. They also celebrate this dedication in Pesaguero on September 8, in Pejanda (Polaciones).

Between the old and amazed the mysterious girl, he played a simple and friendly dialogue, then when the Cigana knew it was the Holy Virgin, fell to his knees, as if shot and sat in silence. So in the fresh morning sounded the voice of Madonna full of sadness and pity. She ordered Cigana to fast with the family for three Saturdays and preach fasting and repentance to all the people of Motta and the towns and villages of the land trevisana: Who had fasted with true repentance, he would have received mercy and forgiveness from the Lord, angry for too many sins of the people. To then leave an indelible memory of his beloved land of apparitions in Motta, the Virgin ordered that in that place was to be built a church. Hierzenberger 1996 p 114",

In fact, he upon arriving at the shrine, he fell exhausted at the foot of the sacred image of Our Lady the Great, sitting majestically on the throne with the Child on her knees. Jerome was in early youth a soldier then, and following the apparitions he received, he dedicated himself to serving others, doing penance and works of charity. At first he lent assistance to the sick and abandoned, later to education of orphans. He founded orphanages in various Italian cities and then, although he was a layman, organized support for the Somaschi Fathers (originally the \"Society of the servants of the poor\", regular clergy). In 1747 Jerome was elevated to the altars by Pope Benedict XIV in 1766 and was canonized by Clement XIII. Finally, in 1928, was declared the patron saint of orphans. Saint Jerome Emiliani is represented in art with the ball and chain in the hands of prisoners.",

Following the event, he carved a wooden a statue of Mary of about 27 cm similar to her appearance and the statue was then placed near a lime tree. After a while a blind man came to to the place to worship the statue, before which he stopped to pray devoutly. Suddenly, as he prayed with intense fervor, regained the gift of sight. The news of the miracle spread and many devotees immediately came to pay homage to the statue of the Madonna. Pilgrims built a wooden church as a place of worship, then in 1512 a nobleman built a stone church and the the statue was brought inside. The pilgrimage continued to grow more and more. In the seventeenth century, Daniel of Osterberg, in addition to drawing the places of Our Lord Jesus Christ's life and painful passion, also painted this place, inspired by the location between the mountains. He wanted to give the title of this portrait \"Silesian Jerusalem\". In 1723 the church of this place, renovated and enlarged, was elevated to the basilica and in some periods counted annually visited by over 150,000 pilgrims.",

She would say \" Autilia, I have chosen to one of the highest business you make will in my name, led by Count Enrico Orsini, in Nola, and tell him that under that bush to the right of my hand, there is a buried my image, for many centuries; I want it to dig the earth and you are building a temple in my honor . \" She went from the count, Autilia was not believed. The next day there was a second appearance in the same place, and this time the face of the youth was marked by a ray of light. Returned the count, this time it was taken seriously, and with the cooperation of Bishop Monsignor Bruno, excavations were undertaken in the place indicated by Our Lady. Here he was found a painting depicting the Virgin between two angels, which was identified as the Immaculate Queen of Victories. Along with the painting he was found a bell weighing about forty pounds, storied inscription \"SS. NICOLAS, Confessor CHRISTI, MARIA VIRGO NOW Pronobis, KAROLUS DEI GRATIA REX SICILIAE\". According to some sources, the Carlo mentioned in the inscription would be Charles II of Anjou , who, after some victory in battle, he would build there a chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas of Bari and the Madonna. Painting and bell would then belong to this ancient building of the thirteenth century [1] . The events of those days were an important event in the history of Liveri, that since then begins a journey to the Marian city, which extends to date [2] . The site of the apparitions became the site of construction of a number of religious structures sovrappostesi over time, and resulted in the current Sanctuary of Santa Maria a wall .

The following day, the 11th of August, standing in the same place to finish his wood cutting, he had the same vision and received the same request. This time, he decided to obey and went down to the village immediately. John was known to be a sober man and both the authorities and the villagers supported him unanimously. In the same year the first stone was laid for the foundation of the church; two years later Pope Leo X approved of worship and pilgrimage.The chapel has been witness to many graces and miraculous signs, most notably the miraculous birth of King Louis XIV - a birth that was difficult to obtain for his royal parents had previously been unable to conceive.",

In the fall of 1521, during his convalescence in the family castle of Loyola, he came into contact with the heavenly world: in that period of isolation, the first ideas of mystical feats began to form in the mind of the young soldier, switching from thoughts of the prowess of chivalry and turning into religious ones. One night, while he was still awake ,he clearly saw an image of the Holy Virgin with the Child Jesus. He received similar apparitions in March 1522 and in February 1523. The apparitions and visions struck him so deeply that they cast a new light on his life. In this period of mystical fervor, Ignatius was brought to \"his inner spiritual truth,\" which help shape his future exercises for the first time. His heart opened completely to the service of God. After healing, he retired into solitude in Manresa, then made a pilgrimage to Palestine and later began the study of philosophy and theology in Barcelona, Alcala, Salamanca and Paris. In 1537, he was ordained a priest and devoted himself to the founding of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), who were at the devoted service of Pope Paul III. Biographies and diaries of St. Ignatius of Loyola tell us that the apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary and our Lord Jesus Christ in his life were frequent.",

Anne suffered from seizures in which she spasmed, blasphemed and was said to be able to utter prophesy \"vexed and tourmented by our gostly enemye the devyll\". After a vision in which she beheld the image of Our Lady of Grace at Ipswich, she was taken to the shrine and \"layde before the ymage of our Blessyd Lady....grevously tourmented and in face, eyen, loke and countenance so grysely chaunged...that it was a terrible syght to beholde\". There in the presence of the whole company, she was restored \"perfytely and sodeynly\". Perhaps More's later spirited defence of the Catholic Church was in small part due to this miracle so close at hand which obviously edified him greatly. Anne, in grateful recognition of the miracle, took the veil and became a nun. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Ipswich",

The legend says that once he fell from his horse and saw Mary dressed as a simple peasant. She helped him and cured him of his injuries. With this event the ground work for hisfor his future conversion was laid and his full dedication to the apostolate of the sick. John lived then as a bookseller in Gibraltar and Granada. Following a sermon of John of Avila, in 1539, he felt very moved and since then decided to devote the rest of his life to caring for the sick. He founded a hospital in Granada in 1540, practiced psychosomatic medicine and devoted himself to healing the physical illnesses of the soul and bringing relief to many patients. To better organize the work of healthcare, he founded the Secular Order of the Brothers of Mercy, which after his death became the Order of Brothers of St John of God's Mercy, who followed the rule of St. Augustine. Papal approval came in 1617. The planned work of the apostolate for the sick developed rapidly and bore much fruit. The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared again to St. John of God, just before his death, leading him to Paradise on the 18th of March 1550.",

According to tradition, the Madonna appeared (2 July 1557) on Monte Leto, to Giovanni Chichizola, a peasant, and showed him a picture of her passing from earthly life, saying that it had been transported by angels from Greece, and that she would leave it on the mountain side as a pledge of her love. The picture was placed in the principal Church of Rapallo for veneration, but two days later it mysteriously disappeared and was again found on a rock at Montallegro. Thereupon the Rapallo people decided that here the Madonna wished the portrait to remain, and they began to build a shrine which was consecrated July, 1558. In 1574 some shipwrecked Greek sailors, recognizing the picture as one which was formerly venerated in Ragusa and which had been missing since 1557, claimed it. After legal proceedings it was surrendered to them but the following day this miraculous painting reappeared in the sanctuary of Montallegro and has since remained there undisturbed. Apparently of Byzantine origin, the portrait represents the Virgin May lying on a bier, surrounded by several saints, and two angels, supporting a representation of the Holy Trinity symbolized by three human bodies merged into one. The feast of Our Lady of Montallegro to whom Rapallo was dedicated, 1739, is observed during the first three days of July. See also: Hierzenberger 1993 p 129",

Then she was still two miles from the church, she heard the sound of the bells-it was already the time of the elevation. She knelt down piously and as she stood up she \"saw the Virgin in a dim light\" holding Jesus' inert body in her arms. \"Look towards the church, my daughter. You will see from here the celebration of the Holy Mystery, as though you were actually present,\" she heard the Blessed Virgin say. Louise looked up and \"saw an illuminated altar and a priest raising the consecrated host\". Later, Louise had a shrine built on the site of the apparition. Since the middle of the 16th century, believers have venerated the Virgin at this shine as \"Our Lady of the Kneeler\". Miracle cures have been claimed and on September 11, 1908, Pius X granted a 300-day indulgence to all those who visited the shrine. Still today, the feast day of September 8th attracts hundreds of believers.",

Quite miserable for the poor reception received, Bertolino he returns home, and the next day, early in the morning, he went again at the olive tree with the hope of seeing the bright image of the Virgin and to be able to trust all its bitterness. The Apparition back! With my heart in my throat, running along the last stretch of the climb, feels humiliated and offended, not because of the injuries received, but rather the failure of the mission played by Madonna. Come close to the tree, the Madonna is there waiting for him. Encourages and exhorts him to return by the Governor, but also the second embassy had greater success than the first. On the third day, Bertolino back in that place now so dear to him. He kneels down and waits to return the Apparition. The Virgin returns: gently and firmly encourages him to demonstrate to the Governor that what he says is true. Without hesitation, Bertolino returns to town. With courage, for the third time, relates how the Virgin commanded him, and insists that they all go up with him up the hill to check the veracity of his story. But this time the injuries plus the beatings. To better put him to trial, the present resort to violence. The miraculous spring Bertolino, from mild temperament, would have been overwhelmed if Madonna had not intervened to free him! Suddenly, who beats him with his arm remains paralyzed and mute. In the hall hangs a heavy silence! Everyone understands to be witnesses of a supernatural and each, in his heart, he asks forgiveness for the offenses committed against the poor Bertolino. The Governor shall convene the frightened pastor, the Canons, and all, in solemn procession, come at the place determined by Bertolino who, with hearts full of joy, leads the procession to the duke's palace miraculous place. All, trasecolati admire the vision, clear and distinct, the Virgin Mary, shining between radiance of dazzling light. And a great new gift store for them the Madonna, as tangible proof of the extraordinary and lasting event, at the foot of the olive is overflowing with a source of pure, fresh water, which still continues to the relief of many sick! The first miracle is the very man who has beaten Bertolino and made fun of him. Sincerely repented, regaining the word and the use of the arm.

Since1540, he undertook a major reform plan, designing to bring the Franciscan Order back to its roots. Although he was met with much resistance on this path, a Brief of Pope Paul IV approved the reform. From 1556, he became provincial of the Spanish reformed convents, under the patronage of the Province of St. Joseph, and received permission to build new convents in Spain and worldwide. Through the charisma of his high mystical graces, the persuasive power of his preaching, and example of his severe life, he led a life of prayer and atonement. Peter had a great influence on his brethren and the faithful, but also the nobility and the government of his country. St. Teresa of Avila praised the mystical qualities of Peter of Alcantara. His book on contemplative prayer is well known and his aspiration to perfect prayer and meditation. Shortly before his death the Mother of God appeared to him and forewarned of his death. He was beatified in 1622 and canonized in 1669.",

When some curious men asked her why she walked alone, she answered, \"Not alone, but with God, the sun, and the stars.\" \"Where are you from?\" \"From nearby.\" \"How do you cross the full ravine, and who helps you?\" \"My sons, don't forget that I go with God, my protector.\" One day some townsfolk followed her and saw her disappear into a cleft in the rock. Then people noticed the rock sparkling and shining, and decided that the mysterious maiden was not someone from the community, but the Virgin Mary. The Virgin's Rock became a place of legend and devotion. Some said that it was the source of three rivers - one of water, one of blood, and one of milk - that the Holy Virgin held back from sweeping away the town. To this day, large numbers of pilgrims gather at the cueva, cave, to place votive offerings, recite rosaries, and sing hymns in thanks for favors granted, especially around the feast of Our Lady of Peace on January 24. On December 21, 1983, the President of Venezuela, Luis Herrera Campins, dedicated a monumental statue of the Virgin of Peace on the rock above the cave. Designed by architect Manuel de la Fuente, of concrete on a steel frame, the monument weighs 1,323 tons and stands 154 feet high, slightly taller than the Statue of Liberty. The Virgin extends one hand and holds a dove in the other. Visitors can go inside and ascend to five lookouts that survey nearly the entire state of Trujillo. In Trujillo Cathedral is a much older devotional statue of Our Lady of Peace, patron of Trujillo city and state. Information from es.wikipedia.org and other sources.",

The two brothers were really surprised and touched by such beauty. The next day, after having taken leave left the house and went away. When they looked back turned, they saw nothing, then realized that Mary herself had hosted them in the house of her sweet heart.",

Mary looked so beautiful that my words cannot explain her to you.\" (...) \"I saw two fountains spouting forth from the Virgin Mary's womb, one of milk and the other of blood. The milk was spread on all the blessed souls of Paradise. (...) The blood was spread on all mankind.\" (...) \"I also heard the Virgin pronounce this verse: \"My heart is stirred by a noble theme; I address my poem to the King\" (Ps 45:1). The word coming from her mouth was Jesus, to whom she gave birth in this world for us. And the Virgin was speaking to the King, i.e. to our Heavenly Father. Then I saw an immense fountain, spouting sprays of water, spreading them everywhere in the world and sending forth torrents of grace.\" Saint Mary Magdalene is depicted in art as a Carmelite with the Instruments of the Passion kneeling before the Holy Trinity. Christ crowns her with thorns, the Virgin gives her roses. She may also be shown receiving the Blessed Sacrament from Jesus; receiving a white veil from the Virgin Mary; being presented to or receiving a ring from Jesus; crowned with thorns and embracing a cross, with rays falling on her from a monstrance; or with flames issuing from her breast.",

He led a life of prayer and penance, by cultivating love of neighbor. Philip Neri also received many mystical graces, but he feared, out of humility, that they become visible. Mary appeared to him several times to help him, comfort him, or warn of a danger: when the prestart of the threat of collapse of a once and on another occasion he recovered from a serious illness. In 1548, aided by a simple priest, Persiano Rosa, who would later become his usual confessor, he founded a pious confraternity responsible for assisting the poor and needy pilgrims in particular. This group would then be transformed and grow in the Oratory, attended by some great spiritual figures. The fraternity was born as a continuation of the talks that began in the confessional. The new methods were used in the help of souls: and the spiritual sermons were delivered in the vernacular, pilgrimages to the basilicas of Rome, simple spiritual exercises and prayers of the people; all this, combined with the character of Philip Neri, made him one of the most sought after spiritual leaders in Rome. He had many enemies who were suspicious of his activities (the austere Pope Pius V had monitored his sermons and the \"country walks\"). Soon, however, he was well accepted everywhere and became the trusted adviser of popes and confessor of cardinals. He was linked fraternally to Ignatius of Loyola, Francis de Sales, Charles Borromeo and Lellis Camillo. He was beatified in 1615 and canonized in 1622.",

He told the people of the apparition. And soon right on the spot where the Lady appeared a chapel was built. A town quickly flourished around it and was called \"Manaoag\". Tradition has it that the town itself was born from the Virgin Mary’s call, thus the term, \"taoag\" meaning \"to call\" was used to name the town. This is where the name Manaoag was derived from, which means \"She Calls\". During World War II, the Church suffered moderate damage. 4 bombs were released on top of the church. 3 bombs landed on the plaza and the facade, destroying them both. One bomb landed in the sanctuary, but failed to explode. The church was rebuilt, and today, it is an active parish serving Manaoag and the surrounding area.",

Since her childhood she felt particularly drawn to a painting of Our Lady of the Rosary Church in Lima. She often went to pray before this image to be enlightened and helped. Rosa received a response several times of the comfort of the Mother of God. The Church Inquisition imposed a thorough examination to be held by her confessor, prior of the Dominican convent of Lima, Fr. Di Lorenzano. The confessor, supported by the consultant for mystical theology, Dr. Juan Castillo, Rosa was asked how Mary had told her about the image of the painting, and she then she says: \"In a silent language without words, without sound and without movement the lips. Her image of the painting of light rays emanating at times thin by which I understand with the intellect, what about the inner Most Holy Virgin, in a deeper way than by a clear vision or words. \" From the hagiographic information of that time we learned she that was in the habit of making twice a year a wonderful dress for the Mother of God. In one of these occasions, the mystic said: \"I Rose of the Mother of God as an unworthy servant of the Queen of Angels, with the help of God sewed a dress for her.\" Embroidered on the gown were six hundred Hail Marys, Salve Reginas as well as many dates and festivals dedicated to the glory of fifteen pilgrimages in the mountains to visit Santa Elisabetta. The velvet and the skirt hems still contained six hundred Ave with an equal number of Salve Regina in glory at the inner joy for the birth of the Divine Child. Rose of Lima was a Dominican tertiary, was beatified in 1668 and was as the first American canonized in 1671, was proclaimed patron saint of Peru and then all of South America, India and the Philippines. \"The Queen of the Rosary\" of Lima was chosen by the King of Spain, Philip IV, as a patron and protector of the country, from 1668, the patroness of Latin America. It is celebrated on August 30.",

But something happened to her--she lost some keys. And the woman became worried because her husband was a \"terrible and cruel man\". In her fruitless searching she came across a Lady sitting on a rock, who asked her: - Woman, why are you crying? What is the matter? At first the village woman did not answer, but she decided to tell about her plight. The Lady advised her to go home and look for the keys in a certain place. Much to her surprise the keys were in the place mentioned by the Lady. Then, she returned happily to the same place where she found the Lady, \"very beautiful and shining\", seated on the same rock. This time the Lady introduced herself: \"I am the Mother of God and I want you to go to the people in the village and tell them to build me a church here with the name of Our Lady of the Sands; and whoever comes here and invokes my name, I will free them of seizures, fevers, and malaria.\" In those times of great superstition there were many people who began to scrape the boulder, trying to get sand to make tea with to cure their ills. The local bishop intervened by giving orders to have the stone taken to his house in Aljubarrota. Strangely, the bishop discovered the next day that the stone had disappeared and returned to its original place. Convinced that someone had stolen it, he had it brought into his room so that he could better watch the steps of any intruder.

An endless succession of wars, famines and plagues had been the lot of the people of the region, and another plague had recently struck the area causing much misery and death. Tradition says that the Blessed Mother appeared to Garino and promised a cessation of plague if the clerics and the people would repair their lives. According to legend, in August 1629, Peter and two companions made a pilgrimage to the nearby shrine of Our Lady of Rocciamelone. There he came across two paintings to an artist to have them restored with every intention of returning them to the shrine the following year. In the final days of Spetmenber of 1630, he returned to Groscavallo. There in the part of the town called Forno Alpi Graiehe he received the message of Our Lady.It was during this time that the two paintings that had been under lock and key mysteriously disappeared, only yo be found under the big boulder on which Our Lady had appeared. Under the direction of the parish priest, a small chapel was built for the two paintings. (In another account, Peter discovered the paintings up in the branches of a tree.)",

Before her are the crown of thorns and the nails.[2] The icon of is painted on a canvas framed in carved wood. The painting itself is set with gold and silver accouterments and precious gems, which are ex votos from her devotees. An inscription found at the back of the painting says: \"A doze de Abril 1692 años Juan Oliba puso esta Stma. Ymagen Haqui\" (\"On 12 April 1692, Juan Oliba placed this most holy image here\"). It is considered an invaluable treasure inherited by the Caviteños, and is the oldest extant dated Marian painting in the Philippines. A legend narrates that many years ago, a small detachment of the Spanish Guardia Civil was stationed at a garita (little garrison, or sentry post) located at the end of the Isthmus of Rosario. One stormy night, a Spanish sentinel was at his post and he perceived a bright, shifting light. A dazzling apparition rose form the currents of Cañacao Bay, startling the sentry with suspicion that it could be pirates out to raid the port (at the time, Cavite was at the peak of economic prosperity because of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade). Frightened, the sentinel shouted, \"¡Alto! ¡Alto!\" (\"Halt! Halt!\"). Instead of stopping, the light proceeded toward him. Hence, in a loud voice he asked, \"¿Quién vive?\" (\"Who is there?\"). He then heard a sweet and melodious voice reply: \"Soldadito, ¿por qué el alto me das en noche tan fría? Dame paso. ¿No conoces a María?\" (\"Little Soldier, why halt me on a night so cold? Give me passage. Thou knowest not Mary?\") The sentinel, struck in awe and confusion, humbly and repentantly replied, \"Perdóname, Virgen María, Reina de mi devoción; pues solo soy un soldado que cumplo mi obligación!\" (\"Forgive me, Virgin Mary, Queen of my devotion; I am but a soldier that complies with my duty!\") The following morning, fisherman and workers at the Cavite Royal Arsenal passed through the Porta Vaga (Vaga Gate) and found a framed image of the Virgin on the beach along Cañacáo Bay near the place of her earlier apparition. They brought the image to the parish priest who temporarily installed it in the parish church. Later, a small chapel was built near the Porta Vaga's walls, and for three centuries it was the icon's shrine. The icon was used to bless the galleon plying between Cavite and Acapulco, Mexico during formal sending off ceremonies, earning her the title \"Patroness of the Galleon.\"",

She had a laughing and shining face, and wavy, golden hair floating over her heavenly face, whose rare beauty filled Elizabeth's soul with admiration and astonishment. Her eyes shone with a bright and soft light, which along with the pleasant features of her face, exuded a charm that inspired Elizabeth's love. On her head was a little hat, and above it a crown of gold enriched with diamonds and pearls. The Lady Caille, praying the pilgrim to go up to her house, she said to her: that first she wanted to go to the church to pay homage to God. She recited her prayer with her, after which they both returned to the house. Then the lady invited thevisitor to rest and have some food; which she refused, saying that the reason for her visit was only to cure her of her ills and to ask her for a dress, since the first of which she was covered was worthless. Having obtained promise of this dress, the visitor disappeared. At six o'clock, Lady Caille, whose heart was still alive with the memory of the marvels she had seen and the pleasure she had felt at the beautiful sight, could not remain silent in the morning. She spoke to her husband, on waking, of all that had happened. As she was finishing her story, six confreres from the chapel of the white penitents knocked at her door, bearing this holy image of Our Lady in a box covered with green taffeta, where she had been sent. They came to show it to her, and to pray to her husband, who was allied to the master of the glass-works, who was two leagues from Bargemon, to procure for them a glass casket to lodge her, while waiting for her to procure some richer dwelling. . Lady Caille, who was still in bed, refecting on her wonderful vision, having heard this, exclaimed immediately that beautiful pilgrim was surely the holy Virgin, who had appeared to her and spoke to her during the night, and whose husband she had just spoken of. She begged him to leave at once and go himself to the glassworks to have a statue created and to make a silvercase to hold it, with the jewels she offered. This miraculous image is now in this shrine of money with the weapons of Sieur Jean Caille, still alive. He himself told me and testified the truth of this event confirmed and made public by the healing of his wife, who was delivered from all her ills, despite the doctors thinking she was nearing the end of her life. She regained her color to the astonishment of everyone and asked that they praise the Virgin Mary for this recovery. This miracle, the first of all those who have been made since the possession of this holy image, evidently shows that the mother of God wished to be honored and served in this city of Bargemon; what she has blessed with numerous miracles.",

To confirm that I want you to advise the Queen to make three novenas in my honor, behold my image at Notre-Dame de Grâces, in Provence, and the appearance of the church.\" Brother Fiacre saw precisely the scene and the choir where the image was (as it is today in Cotignac). He ran to tell his superiors who, never having been to Cotignac either, consulted some friends who'd made the pilgrimage; the descriptions corresponded. The King and Queen, childless after 22 years of marriage, were informed, but while they awaited the Cardinal's approval, Brother Fiacre started the three nine-day prayer petitions in the Queen's name. Nine months after they ended, Anne of Austria gave birth to the future Louis XIV.

When this was built, a small image of the Madonna, a copy of the \"Comforter of the Afflicted\" (Our Beloved Lady of Luxembourg, cf. 1627), was used. This small chapel soon became a point of attraction for the devotees.

While he slept, in the middle of the night, he heard a voice: \"Alexander, do you want to be healed? Then take my statue and bring it to Taferlberg at Marbach on the Danube, then leave it under an oak tree.\" The man did so, took the statue and placed it in the hollow of an oak tree there. After a few days he recovered. Between 1658 and 1661 were seen near the oak numerous apparitions of red and white figures, which, in the light of day as the darkness of the night, hovering in the air, some went to the edge of the woods. During the night the stars illuminated the statue with heavenly light and several candles burned before they appeared. Many people of all ages, even other religious confessions, witnessed these miraculous phenomena. The Bishop of Passau organized a commission of inquiry wo interviewed fifty-seven people who then confirmed under oath what they had seen. Recognized as a supernatural phenomena, in 1660 he set the first stone of the sanctuary. On the two-hundredth anniversary of this event, eight hundred faithful and two hundred faithful priests went on pilgrimage to Maria Taferl. The pilgrimage is still very active.",

In gratitude to the Virgin Mary, he devotedly attached himself to St. Vincent de Paul and was ordained a priest. Soon after he devoted himself with great fervor to the mission and the establishment of popular seminaries. In 1648, he was pastor of Sannt-Sulpice, where he founded his famous seminary for priests. Jean-Jacques was blessed with unusual graces and appearances. In 1649 Mary appeared to him and induced him to resume his life dedicated to prayer, that he had forgotten for a few days. Moved by the mystical graces and the messages of Mary, the servant of God was able to reinvigorate and revive the ideal of the priesthood through his seminaries and theological and ascetic writings. He exerted a great influence on the renewal of the clergy. In 1664 a seminary for priests according to his design was approved as a congregation and spread rapidly in France, America and Africa, as the Sulpicians. In these communities of priests, was put into practice the spirituality and mysticism of the French Oratory. The main points of the spiritual world of Olier was the cult of Most Blessed Sacrament and the Blessed Virgin Mary, the total stripping of oneself in God and the full consecration to Christ. A summary of his whole spirituality is found in the Catechism of the Christian interior life. Semi-paralyzed, dedicated the last years writing spiritual works. Olier died in 1657 at the age of 49 years.",

Then the evangelization of that lands began. The first apparition of the Virgin Mary was in the forest where the Cospes had fled, on September 8, 1652, when the Virgin appeared to the Cacique (ruler) of the Cospes Coromoto and his wife, saying in his own language: \"Go to the white house and ask them to pour water into their head to go to heaven\"; then, the Virgin asked him and his tribe to be baptized. According to oral tradition, Cacique Coromoto told the encomendero don Juan Sánchez about this vision, saying that after eight days of a brief teaching of cathechism, the entire tribe would had been ready to receive baptism. Several indigenous Cospes converted and were baptized, but not the chief, because he did not feel at ease: under a new religion he feared not to be recognized as the legitime chief. Indian Chief Coromoto fled, and took refuge in the forest, the Virgin appeared to him again, and Chief Coromoto, blinded by anger, raised his arm to order the apparition to grab and go. This appearance was confirmed by a miraculous mark made of wood fibers, which were then searched and found. The relic is venerated today in the National Shrine of Our Lady of Coromoto. Cacique Coromoto told the story that he was bitten by a poisonous snake and returned to Guanare wounded and near death, and began to ask in order to receive baptism, which was administered in Barinas region. He got baptized, became Christian and asked the remnant of the group of rebel Cospes Indian under his command to be baptized. Then, after several years, the Chief Coromoto, now with the Christian name of Angel Custodio, died of old age. See also Hierzenberger 1997 p 164 [More on this apparition]",

When suddenly spat blood, a second, third, and another. He saw himself lost, also because the place was deserted, the first houses away. Leaning on his stick, raised his eyes imploring the Blessed Virgin appeared to him that he looked from his chapel, and ... wonder!, next to the chapel sees a noble lady who is smiling and shining. The vision is coming, china hand in the fountain, touches his forehead and exclaimed: \"It's heart, dear son, you're cured.\" At the time of the miracle were other new arrivals that randomly came to drink there. The curate of St. Andrew Don Duci of Bareilly and two other people is a tradition that he was a lawyer with his servant. Bartholomew Burat is like beside himself with astonishment and joy.

The family had gone to church. The image was a rudimentary fresco, walled up the wall on the porch, who represented Mary with Child, this fresco was up to 1648 in the house near the river that had been sold to pay off a debt. Destroyed the house by the new owner, the fresco was miraculously saved and Giacomuzzi carried it into your new home. While the girl was praying absorbed, suddenly, he was rapt in ecstasy. When he recovered his senses he found himself completely healed and told family members that he saw a beautiful lady dressed in white with these words: \"I saw there, next to the picture, a beautiful lady, dressed in white, who smiled at me and calling me. When I was close to the good lady said to me: \"I'm not good in this place, where blasphemy against My Son, of 'your father that he be converted and that makes me carry in a church, on a public road; warn the others of the villa to refrain from the sin of blasphemy. For because of this huge impiety were devastated by hail your campaigns in recent years and are hanging over your head even more terrible punishments; obey all my notes and in this day forward you will not be exposed to the insults of evil that so far has harassed you \". Soon the news has great resonance and reaches to the nobles of the nearby St. Vitus. The family Giacomuzzi decides to accede to the request to transfer to the miraculous image of St. Vitus and provides their oxen for transportation, that is established for the Second Sunday of Easter of the same year (31 March 1655). At the gates of San Vito, near the Church of St. Nicholas outside the walls, the oxen are locked and refuse to continue, despite repeated beatings. The event is interpreted as a clear indication of the Blessed Virgin to keep your image in that Church. It spreads immediately worship and devotion to the image of Our Lady of Rosa, which are attributed to repeated miraculous events. Over the centuries the Church has repeatedly enlarged and embellished to become an important shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Rosa. On 22 March 1945 a final and terrible bombardment completely destroyed the sanctuary and save the bell tower, on which are also evident, even today, the signs of splinters. Among the piles of debris is found, miraculously intact, the image of Our Lady of Rosa. After the war, thanks to the work of the Franciscan friars and the generosity of many of the faithful, we construct a new sanctuary on the opposite side of the highway (463), along which stood the previous year. Even today, the Sanctuary of the Madonna di Rosa is a destination for many pilgrims and reference point for the faithful of the right and left Tagliamento.",

        "description": "The Blessed Virgin Mary often appeared to the abbess Maria Jesus of Agreda (1602-1665), in the family home of this mystic. The Venerable Mary of Agreda with her mother, sister and other women, had transformed the house into a Franciscan convent. In 1627, the visionary was chosen as the abbess and received special graces from Our Lady. Along with many inner experiences and visions, she has left us above all the voluminous work Mystical City of God - Our Lady's life (or the life of the Blessed Virgin and Mother of God appeared to Mary of Agreda, abbess of the Convent of the Immaculate Conception). This work is described as internal visions that are the highest level of mystical experience. In these visions, the abbess is not talking, but it is only a \"channel\", a chosen vessel, through which flow the heavenly apparitions. All the experiences described in the Mystical City of God were then translated into over twenty languages. Of course there were also a number of enemies who, driven by strong rationalist positions, declared the private apparitions of the abbess to be regarded as impossible and a result of the individual imagination. But the positive approvals were many: the decrees of Popes Clement XI and Innocent IX, some bishops approvals, appraisals of the theological faculties of Toulouse, Salamanca, Alcala and Lowen and numerous positive statements by famous theologians and men of the Church. In 1673 the process of beatification of the mystical abbess was begun. In 1849 Mary of Agreda's body was found still incorrupt. The visions also contain an explanation of the common life of Mary and Jesus are comparable to those of the great mystics such as Gertrude the Great, or Bridget of Sweden, or the wonderful visions of Anne Catherine Emmerich, or Jacob Lorber and Theresa Neumann in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Particularly valuable are the real explanation that Most Holy Virgin offers from time to time in response to questions from the abbess.",

Born Orsola Giuliani in Urbino of a comfortable middle-class family, after seeing the Blessed Mother in a vision, she determined to become a Capuchinnun at Città di Castello in Umbria in 1677 against her father’s wishes. She took the name Veronica and had a difficult novitiate because of the severity of her superiors. She is said to have had numerous mystical experiences, including several visions of Our Lord in which she received the stigmata, including those of a crown of thorns on her head. The bishop, in an effort to rule out the possibility of fraud, subjected her to many more trials. She was not allowed to be alone for one moment and she was forbidden to receive Holy Communion. She was not allowed to talk with any of the sisters except those assigned to watch over her, and she was not allowed to communicate with the outside world. Her hands were put into gloves with the fastenings sealed with the bishop's signet. She served as mistress of novices for thirty-four years and abbess for ten, leaving behind a ten-volume spiritual diary. Veronica died on July 9, 1727, and was canonized in 1839. Her feast is not on the General Roman Calendar, but it is celebrated by the Franciscans on this day.",

In June 1671, after overcoming many obstacles of a practical nature, Margaret Mary Alacoque recovered and kept her promise to the Mother of God and entered the convent of the Visitation at Paray-le-Monial.

        "description": "In 1686, a curious happening shook up the village of Celles in the region of Ariege, near Foix: four women violently beat a priest. The priest took the case to court and obtained justice. On May 28, 1686, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, a young peasant boy named John Courdil was coming back from the fields reciting the rosary. He suddenly saw a white pigeon in front of him. As the bird got closer to the boy's farm, near a fountain, it changed into \"a six or seven-year old girl dressed in white\" (statement of July 21, 1686). In his second statement (July 28, 1686), John said that he first saw the pigeon \"three times in front of him,\" then the girl just \"five or six feet from him.\" John was afraid and he tried to flee. \"Do not be afraid, my child,\" he heard a voice say, \"I am the Holy Virgin.\" He knelt down, the apparition did the same. \"Warn the people to change their lives and make eight processions so that the people convert. Otherwise, all is lost [...]. Continue to serve your father and your mother as you have always done.\" The apparition added that the four women responsible for the public disorder must do penance. She asked John to leave his spade near the fountain where she assured him that the water would be good. When he came back to recuperate it, he would find a \"sign\" on the end of the handle. John ran quickly home to the farm and asked his brother and sister to go back and retrieve his spade. The youngsters found it \"standing straight up with three cross-shaped oak leaves coming out of the top of the handle.\" The four women made reparation for their wrongs and people went in procession to the place of the miracle. In early July, the Virgin appeared a second time to John, in his bedroom. \"You did what I asked you to do well, and the fountain will be good; the people have corrected themselves well,\" she told him. A commission of inquiry has identified twenty-eight cures from the water of the fountain. In October 1686, a second inquiry mentioned seven new cases. The chapel of Pla-Rouzaud was built by the poor villagers and blessed on September 8, 1695 by Monsignor de Verthamon. The renown of the shrine Our Lady of Celles spread widely and attracted believers from the entire region and even from Spain. The pilgrimage, which takes place to this day at the restored shrine on the third Sunday of July, is marked by evangelical simplicity and Marian humility.",

One stormy night, while a Spanish sentinel was at his post, he perceived a halo of a bright shifting light. A dazzling apparition rose form the currents of Cañacao Bay startling the sentry with suspicion that it could be pirates who were out to ransack the port because that time, Cavite was at the peak of economic prosperity because of the galleon trade. Frightened, the sentinel shouted \"¡Alto! ¡Alto!\" (\"Halt! Halt!\"). However, instead of stopping, the light proceeded toward him. Hence, in a loud voice he asked, \"¿Quién vive?\" (\"Who is there?\"). He then heard a sweet and melodious voice saying: \"Soldadito, ¿por qué el alto me das en noche tan fría? Dame paso. ¿No conoces a Maria?\" (\"Little Soldier, why halt me on a night so cold? Let me pass. Dost thou not recognise Mary?\") The sentinel, struck in awe and confusion, humbly and repentantly replied, \"Perdóname, Virgen Maria, Reina de mi devoción; pues solo soy un soldado que cumplo mi obligación!\" (\"Forgive me, Virgin Mary, Queen of my devotion; for I am a soldier who complies with my duty!\") The following morning, fisherman and workers at the Cavite Royal Arsenal usually passed through the Porta Vaga (Vaga Gate) found along the beach of Cañacáo Bay a framed image of the Virgin. It was close to the spot where she appeared the previous night. They brought the image to the parish priest who temporarily installed it in the parish church. Later, a small chapel was built near the Porta Vaga's walls, and for three centuries it was the shrine of the Virgen de la Soledad. The icon was used to bless the galleon plying between Cavite and Acapulco (Mexico) during formal sending off ceremonies, earning her the title \"Patroness of the Galleon\". In 1929, a new parish priest, Fr. Pedro Lerena y Lerena of Logrono, Spain, was assigned to the Puerto. At the same time, he was appointed Rector of the Ermita. His great dedication to the cause of the Virgen de la Soledad saw the beautification and the improvement of the Ermita through the years. During the Second World War, Fr. Lerena was able to retrieve the precious image of the Virgin from a junkyard where it was thrown by the Japanese invaders and brought it to the Archbishop’s Palace in Intramuros, Manila and later to the vaults of the Philippine National Bank for safekeeping. It was brought back to Cavite only after the liberation in 1945, this time to her home at the San Roque church because the Ermita was destroyed by Japanese and the combined Filipino-American forces. Until his death in 1972, Fr. Lerena served as the guardian of Cavite’s priceless treasure.",

        "description": "The Madonna's intervention saved Messina during the earthquakes that shook most of Sicily in 1693. On January 9 of that year, when the first tremors began, the Virgin Mary appeared to a sick girl named Paola Alfonsina, daughter of jurist Antonio Pesce. As Benedetto Chiarello, S.J., wrote in 1705, \"Suddenly she saw the window of her little room open unexpectedly, and through it came a marvelous woman dressed in white with a blue mantle\" who smiled at her and said, \"Fear not.\" The Madonna returned during the night and, asked to protect the city, replied that the people should remain joyful and wait in the cathedral before the altar of the Madonna della Lettera. Followed by a tsunami along the entire coast, the January 11 earthquake left 54,000 casualties. Messina suffered damage and flooding but was was spared the brunt of the disaster. Afterwards, the Madonna reappeared to Paola with words of comfort and over the next few days to others as well. Local tradition holds that the Virgin honored the people of Messina by writing a letter to them, dated from Jerusalem, \"in the year of her Son, 42.\" The Byzantine icon of the Madonna della Lettera, behind a golden cover, occupies the high altar of Messina's Cathedral, which was founded around the fourth century and used as a stable during the Islamic occupation, then reconstructed around 1168 and consecrated on 22 September 1197 to the Virgin Mary. The Madonna of the Letter is now also represented by a completely gilded statue in the belltower and by a 20' monument at the harbor entrance, with the huge inscription: \"Vos et ipsam civitatem benedicimus\" (\"We bless you and your city\"), from the letter's text. The harbor statue was unveiled on August 2, 1934 and, thanks to Gugliemo Marconi, fitted with a special device allowing it to be illuminated from the Vatican in Rome. The feast day of Our Lady of the Letter is June 3. www.messinaweb.eu http://www.wherewewalked.info",

On December 30, 1696, at 4:45 pm, when the procession reached St. Francis's Church, its bell sounded the signal for praying the Gloria Patri. Suddenly Don José de Ulloa y la Cadena, chaplain of the Nuns of the Immaculate Conception, was pointing east, exclaiming, \"The Virgin! The Virgin!\" According to official documents in the archdiocesan archives, all present saw the Virgin resting on a cloud between the sanctuaries of Guápulo and Quinche, with a crown on her head, a lily in her right hand, and the Child in her left arm. The apparition lasted throughout the recitation of the Gloria, Our Father, and Hail Mary. Then it faded and the cloud covered the image. Afterwards, the bishop got better, and when fully recovered he authorized devotion to Our Lady of the Cloud, erecting an altar to her in Quito Cathedral. She is honored with an annual fiesta and procession on January 1. See also HIerzenberger 1997 p 1696",

        "description": "St. Louis Marie Grignon de Montfort (1673-1716) was an extraordinary mystic, prophet and apostle of the fervent Marian devotion. Its greatest merit is that he has introduced countless people to the love of the Blessed Mother of God and the practice of Marian devotion. Marian devotion of his inspiration presupposes two elements that combine in one body inseparable: the perfect practice of true veneration of Mary and deeper commitment to Jesus, ie the total consecration of themselves to Christ through daily rededication to Mary. On June 5, 1700 Grignon was ordained priest. In 1701 he became a chaplain at the hospital for the poor of Poitiers of which, after various vicissitudes, was appointed director. From 1706 he devoted himself to parish missions for the people, his true vocation, and founded the Daughters of Divine Wisdom, a hospital dedicated to the Order of Most Blessed Virgin Mary. He was a missionary traveling throughout France, and during these trips was often accompanied by the appearance of a \"Lady dressed in white.\" The apparition was seen by some believers. From the prayers of St. Louis Marie Grignon, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, is the profound influence of these apparitions. Because of the persecution of the Jansenists, who at that time dominated the public and ecclesiastical life, his writings for a long time could not move. Only much later, his treatise on True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin (Traité de la Sainte Vierge à la vraie devotion), which was written in 1842, was widespread. The complete works of Louis Grignon first spread to France and England, then across the German-speaking world, thanks to the publications of the Swiss publishing house Canisius. Grignon was beatified in 1888 and canonized by Pope Pius XII July 20, 1947. The encyclical Ad diem istum, written by Pope Pius X for the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the declaration of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, all written in the spirit of Grignon de Montfort, has promoted the link between the cult of Mary and the modern apostolate. From careful investigation on the mystical Marian Grignon clear the relationship with that of Berulle and Henry Suso.",

In the vision, the Blessed Virgin told him to found a religious order devoted to preaching the Passion of Christ. He later founded the Passionist Order. --- Paul of the Cross (Paul Francis Danei, 1694-1775) was sixteen when his brother fell into a river, Mary. appeared and saved them both from certain death by drowning. Three years later he was converted and received by the office of Madonna leaving the secular world to dedicate himself to the Lord Jesus Christ. In 1715 he enlisted in the Army of the Republic of Venice against the Turks to fight and die as a martyr, believing in this way to serve Christ and do the will of the Holy Virgin. But soon it became clear that, to accomplish the task entrusted to him by Mary, would have to go another way. He then retired for some time in solitude to devote to prayer and atonement and understanding his true path in the world at this time drew up a \"rule\". From his spiritual father, Francesco Arborio, bishop of Alexandria, received the black robe of atonement. Pope Benedict XIII allowed him to seek other brothers, but rejected the rule because too severe. Paul devoted himself to the care of the sick with his brother and was ordained priest in 1727. With some brothers retired to Monte Argentario, where he founded the first home of the Passionists. Benedict XIV approved a less severe form of the rule. During an apparition, Mary Paul explained to the meaning and nature of his pain and induced him to contemplate the sufferings of his Son.

His story, handed down to us in detail by Canon Colombero , began August 18, 1713 when a certain Lorenzo Nicol broke his leg in an area called the Lower and, turning to Mary, vowed to build a pylon there. Immediately healed by divine intervention, the Nicol was able to return to the country and, as often happens, he forgot the promise. On August 20 of the following year, working in the same locality, Lorenzo Nicol was affected by the same disaster. Repented of his past behavior, he prayed to the Virgin Mary because, once again, came to his aid. Our Lady answer the prayers of our workers and allowed him to reach his home. The Nicol no longer disregarded the vow. He built a pylon which formed the origin of the sanctuary and placed in it a statue of the Virgin Mary still worshiped there. The source from which the Colombero took the news about what happened to Lorenzo Nicol in those years, dating back to a script left by the theologian Joseph Bertolo of Mompellato in which the author comments on the fact exceptional. The local people, became aware of the miraculous event, wanted to build a Lower chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows, which replaced the shrine, and where he celebrated his first Mass in 1721. In the following years the building was enlarged to reach the current structure consists of a building, used as a shelter for pilgrims, and the real church consists of three naves, one of which is located in the Municipality of Val della Torre while insist on remaining estate of Rubiana.

He would have to pass by Guarantinqueta, a small city in the Paraiba River valley. The people of Guarantinqueta decided to hold a great feast to honor the Count, and a lot of fish would be needed. However, it was not the season for fish and the water seemed deserted. After many hours of catching nothing, the fishermen were very depressed. Among the fishermen were three men who always prayed to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception -- Domingos Garcia, Joco Alves, and Felipe Pedroso. Before going out to fish, they asked God to help then in this difficult task, to find enough fish at this time when no fish were available. Felipe knelt and prayed, along with his companions, \"Mother of God and our Mother, we need to find fish!\" Just before they were ready to give up, Joco cast his net one more time near the Port of Itaguagu in hopes that they would find fish. However, they found a body of a statue! Joco called out in surprise, \"Domingo! Felipe! Come and see what we have!\" They cast the net one more time and brought up the head of the statue! They very carefully washed the statue and saw that it was Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. They wrapped her in some cloths and continued to fish. Domingo commented, \"We worked all night and have found no fish!\" Felipe had a proposition: \"Let's continue to fish with faith in the Virgin Aparecida (who appeared).\" From this moment on, the net became very full with fish. This was the first miracle of Our Lady of Aparecida. It is not known how the small (less than three feet high) statue came to rest at the bottom of the river, but its artist is known, Frei Agostino de Jesus, a \"carioca'' monk from Sao Paulo who created artistic clay sculptures.The image was made around 1650 and must have stayed submerged in the river for many years because it lost its original polychromy. The image is now a brilliant dark brown color, and is covered by a stiff mantle of richly embroidered thick cloth, allowing only her face and hands to be seen. She wears on her head the imperial crown with precious stones with which she was crowned by the Apostolic Nuncio in 1904. In 1930 Pope Pius XII proclaimed her principal patroness of Brazil. Her feast on October 12 is a national holiday. Pope John Paul II visited the Virgin \"Aparecida\" in her much frequented sanctuary and gave it the title of Basilica. A few days before the visit someone got hold of the statue and threw it forcibly on the floor. Although the frail image was broken into many pieces, the loving and careful work of several artists put it together again and the Virgin, \"Aparecida\" returned to her niche in the Basilica.",

In the right hand of the Madonna holding a crown, she said: \"I am Mary, the Mother of the Lord. Please tell this apparition to the local priest. Do not be afraid! Nothing bad will happen to you. I will be with you. In my name you must announce that every year on this day is set up a feast. \" Only a few believed the story and especially the priest showed himself very skeptical. In another appearance, the Virgin said on Sunday: \"I chose this place as the throne of my Mercy. Those who care to pray there with living faith and grace will not return home empty-handed. Take care that a church be built for large mass flow to my devotees. \" After other vicissitudes, in 1730, an ecclesiastical investigation was ordered on the case which resulted in a positive opinion.

Rosa suddenly starts shouting: \"Mama, look at this dark women with a little baby in its arms!\" Her Mother did not see anything. A few days later, Rosa knelt at the bottom of the grotto in front of a 'mysterious image of the Virgin and Child dressed with a pink robe with golden flowers and a white mantle decorated with stars, standing around 1.40 m high, painted on a flat stone. The Madonna holds a rosary in her right hand that she presents to St. Dominic who is kneeling at her right. Jesus gives a cord to St Francis who kneels on the left of Our Lady. Rays of light encircle the Mother and Child. According to an unknown source, Rosa, who died shortly thereafter, would be resurrected. On September 15th, 1754, a mass was celebrated at that place. On September 16, 1952, the image was solemly crowned.",

She also commanded the builder to put it on the newfound new altar so everyone could see. The next day the mason discovered the place indicated in the dream, a statue of ivory top 11 cm of the Mother of God, a masterpiece of the fourteenth century. The Cardinal Migazzi confirmed the discovery of the miraculous statue. After the discovery of the sacred statue, a new church was built and pilgrims began to flock in large numbers.

        "title": "",
        "description": "It has been reported that George Washington received a vision from a Lady while at Valley Forge, and that she gave him a prophecy. The account of Washington’s vision appeared in a newspaper article first published in the National Tribune in 1859 and reprinted in 1880. Later reprinted in The Stars and Stripes newspaper owned by the National Tribune, in 1931 and the latest printing on December 21, 1950. The vision was related to a reporter named Wesley Bradshaw by an officer who served under General Washington at Valley Forge, named Anthony Sherman. This vision has never been historically confirmed, and there have been some who have made somewhat feeble attempts to discredit it. Thus, it is worth a mention in this paper. In the vision, Washington sees three great trials that the future country of America would face. The vision showed him images of what would later be the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and the greatest threat, a war fought on the soil of the United States as the final conflict near the time of Jesus’ return to reign on the renewed earth. Here is an excerpt from the vision about the final conflict: And again I heard the mysterious voice saying, ‘Son of the Republic, look and learn.’ At this the dark, shadowy angel placed a trumpet to his mouth, and blew three distinct blasts; and taking water from the ocean, he sprinkled it upon Europe, Asia and Africa. Then my eyes beheld a fearful scene: from each of these countries arose thick, black clouds that were soon joined into one. Throughout this mass there gleamed a dark red light by which I saw hordes of armed men, who, moving with the cloud, marched by land and sailed by sea to America. Our country was enveloped in this volume of cloud, and 1 saw these vast armies devastate the whole country and burn the villages, towns and cities that I beheld springing up. As my ears listened to the thundering of the cannon, clashing of swords, and the shouts and cries of millions in mortal combat, I heard again the mysterious voice saying, ‘Son of the Republic, look and learn.’ When the voice had ceased, the dark shadowy angel placed his trumpet once more to his mouth, and blew a long and fearful blast. Instantly a light as of a thousand suns shone down from above me, and pierced and broke into fragments the dark cloud which enveloped America. At the same moment the angel upon whose head still shone the word ‘Union,’ and who bore our national flag in one hand and a sword in the other, descended from the heavens attended by legions of white spirits. These immediately joined the inhabitants of America, who I perceived were well nigh overcome, but who immediately taking courage again, closed up their broken ranks and renewed the battle. Again, amid the fearful noise. of the conflict, I heard the mysterious voice saying, ‘Son of the Republic, look and learn.’ As the voice ceased, the shadowy angel for the last time dipped water from the ocean and sprinkled it upon America. Instantly the dark cloud rolled back, together with the armies it had brought, leaving the inhabitants of the land victorious! Then once more I beheld the villages, towns and cities springing up where I had seen them before, while the bright angel, planting the azure standard he had brought in the midst of them, cried with a loud voice: ‘While the stars remain, and the heavens send down dew upon the earth, so long shall the Union last.’ And taking from his brow the crown on which blazoned the word ‘Union,’ he placed it upon the National Standard while the people, kneeling down, said, ‘Amen.’ The scene instantly began to fade and dissolve, and I at last saw nothing but the rising, curling vapor I at first beheld. This also disappearing, I found myself once more gazing upon the mysterious visitor, who, in the same voice I had heard before, said, ‘Son of the Republic, what you have seen is thus interpreted: Three great perils will come upon the Republic. The most fearful is the third, but in this greatest conflict the whole world united shall not prevail against her. Let every child of the Republic learn to live for his God, his land and the Union.’ With these words the vision vanished, and I started from my seat and felt that I had seen a vision wherein had been shown to me the birth, progress, and destiny of the United States.",

        "description": "The pious nun Anne Catherine Emmerich is famous for her mystical gifts and holy stigmata, including a bloody cross on her chest which appeared on August 28, 1812 and every Wednesday thereafter. She was born in 1774 in Flamske at Coesfeld (Westphalia). In 1802, after overcoming some difficulties, she entered the Augustinian convent of Agnetenberg to Diilmen. Since childhood she had the gift of a profound religious and cosmic consciousness and received many visions of heaven: the angels, the Church triumphant of heaven and earth and the suffering of the Church, the communion of saints, of Jesus Christ, His Life and His sorrowful Passion, the Madonna and her life, her ancestors and parents, Joachim and Anna was often seen among the Essene community. The servant of God was accompanied spiritually in her travel in Purgatory, by her guardian angel that was next to her on many other occasions. The seer was also accompanied by the sacred souls of Clare of Montefalco, Juliana of Liege, St Rita of Cascia and her deceased sister, Clara Sóntgen; also was often comforted in the expiatory sufferings of St. Ignatius and St. Augustine, from which she drew useful lessons. Her mission of atonement and perpetual dedication to the poor souls in Purgatory, for all the suffering of the Earth and for the renewal of the Church, was rewarded by the Lord Jesus Christ by grace more sublime than the holy stigmata. Anna Catherine was subjected to strict examination and inspection by the ecclesiastical commission and temporal investigation systems used many times very cruel (even came to get their fingers in the wounds). Finally, all were agreed in the certificate the absence of every possible trick and recognize the stigmata of the pious nun as truly supernatural. The writings in the diary of her physician, F.W. Wesener, from doubting Thomas to become faithfully devoted, try the heroic virtues and special mystical gifts of the servant of God: no power, knowledge of human hearts, recognition of the relics of saints, knowledge of medicinal herbs, all the mysteries of the Bible faith, participation in the spirit in the afterlife, all thanks to knowledge infused by the Holy Spirit. From 1819, until the day of her death in 1824, the visions of Anne Catherine Emmerich were carefully recorded in about sixteen thousand sheets from the German Romantic poet Clemens Brentano (who later converted to Catholicism). The poet sat almost continuously for about six years by the side of the pious nun. The bitter sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ was published by Brentano himself, knew the other visions long after many editions and were translated into major languages. A part of the mystical visions still remain unpublished. In the book The Life of the Virgin Mary and The Poor Life of Our Lord Jesus Christ have documented numerous contemplations Marian, in furtherance of our knowledge about the earthly life of Our Lady. The collection of views on the life of Mary. Especially can be considered a veritable treatise on mystical Marian (comparable to the visions of Mary Agreda, and Teresa of Konnersreuth and partly also to those of St. Bridget of Sweden and Jakob Lorber). In the summer of 1823 Anna Catherine had reached the limit of her strength. In these last days she gave her outlooks on life and Passion of Jesus, while contact with the Holy Virgin was becoming more alive: \"She who honors the glorious Mother of God will be encouraged by her devotees who will intercede for her at the Divine son. During the temptations should put his image on the chest. \" The pious nun died in the embrace of of the mystical sufferings of Our Lord on February 9, 1824. In 1892 her cause of beatification was Introduced , which is still ongoing. She so loved the Blessed Virgin Mary, that she imitated her virtues with deep devotional fervor, was able to relive her life in its smallest details, and endure the same suffering in silence as the heroic true mystics.",

Upon inquiring why, Our Lady answered, “Behold, my daughter, such great ungodliness.” Blessed Elizabeth then saw “apostates brazenly trying to rip her most holy Son from her arms. Confronted with such an outrage, the Mother of God ceased to ask mercy for the world, and instead requested justice from the Eternal Father. Clothed in His inexorable Justice and full of indignation, he turned to the world. “At that moment all nature went into convulsions, the world lost its normal order and was filled with the most terrible calamity imaginable. This will be something so deplorable and atrocious that it will reduce the world to the ultimate depths of desolation.” When Pope Blessed Pius IX authorized Elizabeth Canori Mora’s cause for canonization to proceed, for years, all her writings were scrupulously examined for doctrinal errors, to guard against the dangers of being misled by a false mystic. The ecclesiastical censor commissioned by the Holy See released his official judgment on November 5, 1900.

The superior general of the congregation, in the circular letter of New Year's Eve 1905, wrote of Justine, \"Sister Bisqueyburu had a particular devotion to the Blessed Virgin, a devotion that shone in the words and how fervently praying the rosary.\" Our Lady appeared six times to Sister Justine Bisqueyburu the following dates: January 28, 1840, February 8, 1840, August 15, 1841, September 13, 1841, May 3, 1842, September 8, 1846. The Mother of God had her heart in her right hand surrounded by flames and in the left scapular or rather a sort of half of a scapular (remember that one a medallion scapular proper). The Mother of God urged the servant of God to introduce and spread this \"green scapular\" in honor of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Ten years after the apparitions received from Catherine Laboure, this sister of the Order of the Vincentians came into contact with the Holy Virgin. The Green Scapular on one side, an image of the Virgin and on the other, a heart on fire with glowing rays of the sun, pierced by a sword and surrounded of an inscription, oval-shaped and topped by a golden cross , bears these words: \"Immaculate Heart of Mary pray for us now.\" The color green symbolizes the confidence in the omnipotence of the merciful Virgin Mary before the throne of God. Sunday September 8, 1846 Holy Mary addressed Sister Justine in Versailles and revealed the meaning of the scapular: \"If the scapular will be taken with confidence give rise to a large number of conversions and will provide a good death for the infidels. \" Pope Pius IX in 1870 approved the scapular. Since then, many prayers have been answered, many conversions have occurred first and miraculous healings of serious illnesses (especially cancer and lung disease). This scapular does not presuppose any membership in a religious order or brotherhood, in no confession nor to Christianity. It can also be given to people far from God to love and recommend them to Mary. But those who wear the scapular must recite the following prayer: \"Immaculate Heart of Mary pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen \". --------- On January 28, 1840, the Virgin appeared to Justine Bisqueyburn, orginally from Mauléon, postulant at the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent DePaul. The apparition asked her to love her \"Immaculate Heart\". On February 8, 1840, the Virgin appeared and gave her the Green Scapular. The apparition occurred again on: August 15th and September 8, 1846 (always in Versailles). In 1855, Sr. Justine went to Constantinople to treat the wounded of the Crimean War, then to Algeria from 1858 to 1867, as the superior of the miltary hospital of Dey.

Durie that the Curé was talking about. \"She will be cured, but not yet\", said the voice. As she could not contain herself any longer Mme. Durie pushed the door open. And there she saw the Most Holy Virgin, of middle height, clad in a robe of dazzling white, sewn with golden roses. Her shoes seemed to be white as snow. Her hands gleamed with the richest diamonds. Her brow was circled with a crown of stars shining like the sun. Mme. Durie was dazzled! When she lifted her eyes to Hers, Our Lady smiled sweetly.

Pierre De Smet started St. Mary's mission with the Flathead Indians in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana, an orphan boy went to an old woman's tipi to study prayers in preparation for baptism Christmas day. As Little Paul, 11, told Fr. De Smet not long afterwards, he saw someone wonderful there: \"Her feet did not touch the earth, her garments were as white as snow; she had a star over her head, a serpent under her feet; and near the serpent was a fruit which I did not recognize. I could see her heart, from which rays of light burst forth & shone upon me. When I first beheld all this I was frightened, but afterward my fear left me; my heart was warmed, my mind clear, and I do not know how it happened, but all at once I knew my prayers.\" Unsure if the radiant visitor was a man or woman, Little Paul said that the same person had come to him in sleep, \"pleased that the first village of the Flatheads should be called 'St. Mary.'\" Fr. De Smet identified the boy's helper as the Blessed Virgin, and the following year, on May 31, had a statue erected at the apparition site, dedicated in procession on Corpus Christi as Our Lady of Prayer. Sadly, within ten years Little Paul was dead and the mission closed. Jesuits built a new St. Mary's Church there in 1866, which closed in turn in 1891 after the last of the Flatheads were moved to a reservation 45 miles north. In 1921 St. Mary's reopened as a parish church. The chapel of 1866 has been renovated as part of St. Mary's Historic Mission, a nondenominational tourist attraction run by a private foundation.

She said that sacrilegious and blasphemous acts today are adding to the spit and mud that Saint Veronica wiped away that day. According to Sister Marie of St Peter, in her visions Jesus told her that He desired devotion to His Holy Face in reparation for sacrilege and blasphemy, which He described as being like a \"poisoned arrow.\" She wrote The Golden Arrow Holy Face Devotion (Prayer) which she said was dictated to her by Jesus.

        "description": "The spiritual life of St. John Bosco (1815-1888) was deeply marked by the inspiration of the Holy Virgin. Mary appeared to him in a dream as a child and then in actual visions. St. John Bosco was born in Castelnuovo d'Asti (now Castelnuovo Don Bosco), from a poor family. His father died when he was only two years and his mother Margherita raised him with tenderness, teaching him to see God in nature. John studied, but with difficulty, to enter the seminary. He had constantly prayed to God to clear a path for him. In the meantime, He made His way into his heart with a call to help poor children and maladjusted misfits. In 1846, inspired by the mystical visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary, he founded the Congregation of the Salesians of Don Bosco, the Salesian Cooperators and the union, made up of priests and lay collaborators, created not as a religious order, but as an \"association\". The members do not wear the robe of a religious order, but they are organized and operate for one purpose: the education of children and street youth, to develop in them a Christian conscience and discover skills. Don Bosco had pledged before God to make efforts so that the children could go out and ended up in prison, never to return, and the others never enter it. His catechism classes were held behind bars ever followed. Don Bosco wrote: \"As I made them feel the dignity of man, felt a pleasure in the heart and strive to become better people.\" Leaving a visit to the prisons took the final decision: \"I must be the savior of those young people. It must be prevented at all costs that come in there. \" Thus the Salesians were bor . The Organization was approved by the Church in 1874. In 1872 Don Bosco founded with Mary Mazzarello the daughters of Mary, Help of Christians, also known as Salesian Sisters. Francis de Sales, Philip Blacks, Alfonso Liguori and St. Joseph Cafasso were the masters and formed the school spirit. John Bosco had the mystical gifts from God to perform miracles and prophesy, also received the gift of the union of heart and intuition. He left, besides the Salesians, the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Salesian Cooperators and the Shrine of Mary Help of Christians in Valdocco (Turin) and sixty-four houses of Salesians in six nations. He published and wrote a popular series of books \"for the people and the children of Christian people.\" Old age came early and he was rushed from work with ruthless debt obligations. Don Bosco was just forty-seven years old when he died. When someone ask him to list the great works he accomplished, Don Bosco replied: \"I have not done anything, it is Our Lady who has done everything.\" At the center of his life remains a deep mystical union with Mary. His incorrupt body lies in the Basilica of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1929 he was beatified, canonized in 1934. In 1950 he was named the Catholic patron saint of publishing associations and apprentices.",

She foretold of a cholera epidemic and interceded for the healing of many who sought her help. --------- In 1850-52, a period when Poland was partitioned between Russia and Prussia, Mikolay Sikatka often went to pray before a portrait of the Madonna found by Thomas Klossowski (see Leipzig, 1813), in the Marian chapel in the woods. The pastor Mikolay, a very pious man, one day saw the Blessed Virgin Mary before the portrait and she commissioned him to exhort the people to recite the rosary and to contemplate the sufferings and death of the Lord. In a second appearance, she reconfirmed the appointment and left a special message to the priests, urging them to celebrate and keep in mind the great value of the Mass. On the third appearance the shepherd saw Mary wrapped in a red robe and a white mantle with a precious crown. The Blessed Virgin spoke of conversion and the fate of Poland, the rebirth of the nation, but the first that a war would happen and an epidemic with millions of victims. Then the Virgin disappeared with these words: \"The peoples of the world will marvel when their hopes for peace depend on Poland.\" The shepherd seer had to suffer much when he informed the authorities, and he was even arrested and tortured in prison. However, when cholera spread and claimed many victims, the messages and apparitions that the pastor had reported, were carefully screened by the ecclesiastical authorities and declared true. In September 1852, the special commission had carried the miraculous painting of Lichen in the church, the procession carrying the portrait of the Madonna in the church was attended by more than eighty thousand faithful. Some years later, to accomodate the great movement of Marian devotion (worship was carried out in penance and was characterized by a national spirit), a shrine was erected, where the miraculous painting of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God was transferred to. The seer died in 1857, his body was found incorrupt even forty years later. The September 15, 1967, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, who when he was still a student when he received the grace of a miraculous cure before the picture of Our Lady, celebrated the coronation portrait of the Blessed Virgin Mary in front of one hundred and fifty thousand pilgrims.",

Sinners are more numerous than the drops of rain. My Son has the hands and feet nailed, the Five Wounds open. If sinners are not converted, my son will have to allow the end of the world. And you will be content to live three or four months, or you reach the end of the world? - I would rather die! \"Asked Mrs. pray:\" Every day seven Our Fathers, Hail Marys and Glorias by Gore five Our Fathers, Hail Marys and Glorias by the Five wounds and seven Our Fathers, Hail Marys and Glorias for me that my name Our Lady of Sorrows. \" While reciting the prayers requested by the Virgin, Veronica hears a voice: \"Veronica, along with your mother go to the bishop and tell him that a chapel should be built.\" \"But I don't even believe!\" \"Go, tell him, and you will believe.\" Veronica and her mother went to convince Mons. Barzellotti, bishop of Pitigliano, that the story is worthy of interest. On July 20, 1853, he notified Pius IX. On the following August 13, the Pope requested that an investigation be opened and that a chapel be built if the findings were positive. Mons. Barzellotti took ill and died in 1861. The bishop of the diocese of Acquapendente (†1877) spearheaded the investigation. Veronica was deposed by a jury. Meanwhile, she became a third order Franciscan. There was evidence of some healing, such as Veronica's mother, who had a diagnosis of a tumor. On September 8th, 1864, they began to open a church at the location of the apparition for the faithful. It became a parish church. The circumstances delayed the judgment of the ecclesiastical commission. On March 25, 1978, Mons.

Starting from the Chapel of the Apparitions, the march is directed to the church where the Madonna had imprinted on the hand of the seer that all gold cross, which accompanied him until his death, a visible sign of the authenticity of the apparitions. With great joy we hear the voice of Don Vittorino Ghenda, you spend so much for the sanctuary , the good news of the diocesan commission, established by Archbishop Andrea Track Mazzocato for the study of the truth of the apparitions, sure that it will give new impetus to what Heaven wanted to start, repeating to us the recommendation made ??by the Virgin in Teresina: \"Dí his mother and all to sanctify Sundays and holidays, but especially not to blaspheme, which gravely offends God, and observe the fasts prescribed by the Church.\" It is right to think. Who knows what Madonna would not do well here, as already in Lourdes, when finally we wake ourselves in all the surrounding countries, near and far, in imitation of the good people of Porzus / Por?inj, appreciating the great gift that the Virgin still there It offers to present and eternal salvation.

Those who were with Gabriel when he died on February 27, 1862 reported that at the moment of death, he sat up in bed and his face became radiant as he reached out to an otherwise unseen figure that was entering the room. It was the opinion of his spiritual director, Father Norbert that Saint Gabriel had seen the Virgin Mary at the very moment of his death. He is remembered for his atonement, his deep veneration for the Mother of Sorrows and his unwavering patience throughout his deadly disease. In 1908 he was beatified and canonized in 1920. He is the patron of Catholic youth in Italy. His grave still attracts many pilgrims. He was the heavenly companion of St. Gemma Galgani (see Lucca 1900).",

At all events, Our Blessed Lady appears to have special designs over him, since he is her chosen instrument for propagating devotion to her as Queen of Angels, being Director of the Arch-Confraternity. For thirty years, M. Marie Frederic de Bray had been the victim of a very serious malady, which, during the last two of these thirty years, had been complicated with three others of an equally mortal character. All means, ordinary and extraordinary, had been tried. The most eminent physicians of Paris, Montpellier, Turin, and Florence had been consulted: science had declared itself powerless, and God himself seemed deaf to prayers. His Eminence the Cardinal of Clermont Tonnerre, Archbishop of Toulouse, and several relatives of M. de Bray, all persons ot distinguished rank in the world, had entreated the holy Prince Hohenlohe to pray for him, but the prayers of the German thaumaturgus were without any apparent result. There was no hope—death seemed inevitable. M. de Bray was nevertheless only thirty-six years of age. He was very pious, and had immense devotion to the Blessed Virgin. One day he heard the voice of this divine Mother, who said to him, \"Make a vow to go on a pilgrimage to Our Lady of Angels at Assisi, and I will cure thee.\" Some days after this, the physicians declared that at eight o'clock in the evening he would be no more. \"He has no pulse; his agony is nearly over; he will pass away imperceptibly,\" said they to the peasants who had come from the village to make inquiries. (It was the 22nd of July, 1856.) Just as the great clock of the Chateau de Bellevue (belonging to the De Bray family) struck twelve at midnight, and as the dying man was breathing his last sigh, he suddenly gathered up the little strength left, and said with his failing voice to Our Lady, who was present, assisting him, \" I make my vow.\" At that instant he was cured. \"I am cured,\" he cried out, and, to the astonishment of his mother and relations, he rose up, in fact, radically cured. The next day Dr. Portes, a physician who had attended him for thirty years, and who fully expected to find him dead, exclaimed upon seeing him and stirring,\" This is a real miracle.\" And so it was, and well worthy of the power and goodness of Mary.

After the death of her parents she was adopted by an uncle and went to live in Egypt. At the age of thirteen years she was betrothed. The night before the wedding day, she heard the voice of Jesus come from the depths of her heart that whispered these words clearly: \"All things pass. If you give me your heart, I will always be with you. \" After receiving this message, the small Arab wished to remain forever the mystical bride of the Redeemer and did not want to get married. Since then she was treated like a slave, and suffered all kinds of abuse. She was a daughter of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, and when she had the courage to say this was nearly slaughtered by her brother, with whom she had sought refuge. She lay unconscious and was believed dead. The night of the 18th of September 1858, she was thrown into an alley in Alexandria. Mirijam was about to die when a beautiful lady appeared wrapped in a blue dress that woke up, bringing her to life in a miraculous way. When she opened his eyes and saw the Holy Virgin she heard these words: \"Be happy even if you suffer and suffer for God, He sends you only what you need, accept always good.\" After having warned about the temptations of the devil and encouraged to engage in love of neighbor, she prophesied that she would live in a convent in France and would die in the guise of Caramel in Bethlehem. Then she disappeared. All that the Holy Virgin had predicted happened: Mirijam entered the Carmelite Order in 1875 and then founded the Caramel of Bethlehem, where he died August 26, 1878, after living a life full of mystical graces, penance, atonement and suffering . 1997 pp 206-207",

Magdalene Kade , a woman of thirty-one born in this village, suffered for many years from a series of very serious illnesses. An orphan, she lived with her 34 year old brother Joseph, with his wife Cecilia and their five children. On January 13, 1866 at two in the morning, Mary Magdalene was in bed and could not speak due to extreme weakness. A dear friend watched her. The patient paused to contemplate the portrait of Our Lady of Sorrows on the wall opposite the bed. At four AM, Magdalene suddenly called her friend and said, excitedly, \"Look at that shine! Look at that beauty.\" The friend looked but saw nothing. Magdalene was the only privileged one to see the splendor of a lady dressed in white, with a golden tiara in her hair, close to the bed. Magdalene trembled and knew that she had received a visit of the Blessed Virgin Mary! The Madonna moved her lips silently said, \"My daughter, now you are healed!\" And then she disappeared. The patient was able to quickly get up and find that she was completely healed. A bishop's commission examined the miraculous event and recognized the healing and supernatural character. In the period between 1870 and 1885 a neo-Romanesque church was built and was elevated to minor basilica by Pope Leo XIII, who officially consecrated it and dedicated to Mary, \"Help of Christians.\" This shrine is still an important place of pilgrimage. Meanwhile in 1884 the first stone of the convent of the Redemptorists was laid that the following year, and they took custody of the church and the care of pilgrims. On December 10, 1905, Magdalene Kade died in Gerorgswalde and was given a solemn funeral. She had sold everything to help with expenses of building the church sanctuary. On September 13, 1886, at Kathenhof, a mother sadly wrapped her legs of her child for amputation in the linen cloth that was laid at the feet of Our Lady in Philippsdorf. The child felt a strong sensation of heat and after three days he was completely cured. This child became a missionary priest in the Congregation of Divine Word in the Netherlands. In the same year, the chaplain Father Francis Storch said he recorded eleven sets of miraculous healings and graces received through the intercession of the Virgin Mary venerated at Philippsdorf.",

At the age of 23 years, was confined to bed because seriously ill, February 22 1873, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to her twice in the same day: the morning at 11 and 15. The Mother of God was dressed in black and was carrying a large white cross. The first appeared in a silent way, the second time he spoke to the Blessed Virgin Mary, consoled her and promised healing, also asked her if she was ready to receive the holy stigmata. Then the Virgin disappeared. From this time began to prime a life of intense atonement for the sins of the world and for the poor souls. She received the holy stigmata, and the grace of many visions and contemplations of the Mother of God, Jesus Christ and the saints. As the Virgin had announced , the visionary recovered on May 2. Suddenly her face flushed, she put on her clothes and prepared to join a meeting with nearly two thousand people who wanted to see her. He wanted to make them witnesses to the promise of Our Lady. On October 7, Marie Julie received the wounds from the crown of thorns, and on November 25 a sore shoulder, where Jesus carried the weight of the Cross, in January of 1874 manifested wrists the marks of the ropes with which Jesus was bound, on February 21 appeared the imprint of the ring on the ring of mystical marriage \" (visible up to 1909). Since 1930 the stigmata disappeared, remaining only partially visible and sometimes bleeding. The seer also had many visions on the future of France, the Church and the world saw terrible revolutions, wars and devastation, but also that France would bloom again and renew the Church. The Church's position before this case was not unique: the Bishop Fournier, responsible for the diocese, knew and believed in the apparitions, the visionary who had had their origin and the mystical. On the death of Fournier, three weeks later, Marie Julie was excommunicated. After examination, the office of the holy Cardinal Rampolla was positively convinced of the sincerity of this mystical woman. The new bishop, however, decided not to recognize the groups in order to not to alienate its adverse clergy. Theologians and church experts, after examining her too, became convinced that the seer was not faking as many suspected. In 1888 Marie Julie was rehabilitated and then returned to the sacraments. The Church's position was very inconsistent in the face of this case: while the Bishop Le Fer de la Motte (1914-1955) was full of kindness towards the mystic, took care of the contacts, visited her and begged her to ask her prayers and the sin offering for the diocesan clergy; his successor, however, paid no attention to the seer. Almost all the ecstasies and contemplations of Marie Julie were noted, for many years in thousands of pages by Charbonnier and other brothers. Much has been lost in recent years of the seer, especially with the death of all family members, after having cared for over the last year when the mystic died. In 1972 he tried to retrieve all records that remained and were later published. Among the many messages that Marie Julie has left us, they are marked by her expiatory suffering for the confirmation of the secrets of La Salette and Fatima. Father Pius expressed himself thus on Marie Julie: \"She lives like a purple shadow, the better to shine the light of Truth.\"",

Because of disobedience against the bishop of Metz Willibrord Benzler OSB, this community was dissolved.

Eventually Our Lady promised the two girls to heal the father of one of them and the mother of the other, suffering from incurable diseases. In fact, both people were healed and the girls explained the reason for the miraculous origin and relatives. Soon a large number of pilgrims visited the place (called \"Capitagna Angel\") where the Madonna had appeared. The pilgrimage was struck down by police and military, and the girls had another apparition of the Blessed Virgin and was miraculously saved from persecution. They were taken to God at still at an early age.",

This event so rich in supernatural phenomena is also connected by a miraculous healing from possession: that of Barbara Eder. The apparitions were manifested in the period between December 1 through 21, 1876 and again, one last time, Mary appeared in 1878. The main visionaries, Caroline Kraus, Francis Xavier Kraus, Teresa Liebl Sack and Matilda, were all aged between eight and fourteen years, and some adults should be added to the group who saw part of some aspects of the apparitions. The boys had the privilege of receiving the apparitions of the Virgin, the Child Jesus, and sometimes also of St. Joseph and several rows of angels and saints, as well as to see light phenomena. These events were detailed protocolled by the parish priest and the competent bishop, Ignatius Senestrey of Regensburg. The latter, however, immediately distanced himself from the apparitions and was from the beginning decided to suspend the investigation. Contrary to its decisions, several professors, priests and monks of the monastery of Metten protested in Rome. Thus was opened a new investigation. It was hoped in ecclesiastical recognition when the twenty year old Barbara Eder, who suffered from severe forms of possession, was miraculously cured by bathing in the spring of the forest, where they had manifested the phenomena considered supernatural. Despite this alleged extraordinary healing, the bishop refused further investigation. With the death of Father Francis Nock and his father Ugo Dieringer, both monks of the monastery of Metten in favor of opening the investigation ecclesiastical dissolved any hope of a possible recognition and vanished the possibility of building a memorial chapel in the woods.

Very little is known of the nature of the messages. But we know that the main message of her appearances was this: \"I want you to recite the rosary every day.\" Following the news of the apparitions developed a remarkable pilgrimage, encouraged by the local parish priest. Most of the pilgrims arrived in that place (then part of the Prussian territory) from Poland. The miraculous case was examined by the competent Ordinariate of Frauensburg who gave an unfavorable opinion to the recognition of the apparitions.

After some futile attempts to show Therese that she was by her side, Marie knelt by the bed with her sisters Celine and Leonie, and began praying fervently before the statue they later called the \"Virgin of the Smile.\" Therese also turned towards the statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Suddenly Marie saw Therese's face grow calm and her eyes clear. They all realized that something extraordinary was happening. We shall let Therese herself describe what happened next: \"All of a sudden the Blessed Virgin appeared beautiful to me, so beautiful that never had I seen anything so attractive; her face was suffused with an ineffable benevolence and tenderness, but what penetrated to the very depths of my soul was the ravishing smile of the Blessed Virgin.\" \"At that instant, all my pain disappeared, and two large tears glistened on my eyelashes, and flowed down my cheeks silently, but they were tears of complete joy. Oh! I thought, the Blessed Virgin smiled at me, how happy I am, but I will never tell anyone, for my happiness would then disappear. \"Without any effort I lowered my eyes, and I saw Marie who was looking at me lovingly; she seemed moved and appeared to know the favor the Blessed Virgin had given me. Oh! it was really to her--to her touching prayers that I owed the grace of the Queen of heaven’s smile. Seeing my gaze once again fixed on the Blessed Virgin, she cried out:“Thérèse is cured!”",

She was confused and frightened, and began to run away from the place. The voice called again, and this time Karmela realised that the voice was coming from within the chapel, she went inside and said her usual prayers. The voice which had come from the image of the Blessed Virgin asked her to recite three Ave Maria in honor of the three days Her body remained in the tomb before Assumption to Heaven. Karmela did as the voice asked and went on her way. Shortly afterwards Karmela fell ill and remained confined to her bed for more than a year. After this time, Karmela revealed her secret to a friend, Francesco Portelli, who in turn told her that about the same time he also heard a woman's voice asking him to pray from within the chapel. Shortly after this mysterious call Francesco's mother was miraculously healed by the intercession of Our Lady of Ta` Pinu. The lonely chapel became a place of pilgrimage for many people on the island and beyond. Bishop Pietru Pace was informed about these events and after speaking to Karmela and Francesco he concluded that the voice was of heavenly origins. Devotion to Our Lady of Ta` Pinu grew rapidly, and numerous pilgrimages flocked to the chapel.",

Suddenly, more quickly indeed than usual, I felt a piercing sorrow for my sins; but so intense that I have never since experienced the like again. The sorrow was so great that I thought I must die. After that I felt all the powers of my soul in recollection. My intellect knew nothing except my sins and offences against God; my memory recalled each one, and made me see all the torments Jesus had endured to save me. My will moved me to detest them and be willing to suffer anything in expiation. A world of thoughts surged through my mind; thoughts of sorrow, love, fear, hope and encouragement. \"This was quickly followed by a rapture, and I found myself in the presence of my heavenly Mother, with my guardian angel on her right. He commanded me to make an act of contrition, and when I had done so my Mom said to me: 'Daughter, in the name of Jesus I forgive you all your sins,' and added, 'Jesus, my Son, loves you very much, and wishes to give you a grace. Would you know how to become worthy of it?' In my misery I knew not what to answer. Then She continued: 'I will be a mother to you; will you show yourself a true daughter?' And after saying this She opened her mantle and covered me with it. At that instant Jesus appeared with all His wounds open; but blood no longer issued from those wounds, but flames of fire. In an instant those flames came and touched my hands, feet and heart. I felt I was dying and should have fallen had not my Mom held me up, I remaining all the while covered with her mantle, and thus I remained for several hours. Afterwards my Mom kissed me on the forehead, then everything vanished and I found myself kneeling on the ground, but still feeling intense pain in my hands, feet and heart. I got up to go to bed and saw blood flowing from those places where I felt the pain. I covered them up as best I could and then, with the help of my guardian angel, got into bed.\" [From the \"Autobiography of St Gemma Galgani\"]",

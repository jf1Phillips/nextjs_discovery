One morning after a night spent in prayer vigil, he saw the Mother of God with a large throng of angels and saints in his presence to celebrate the Sacrifice of the Mass. Two years later the bishop of Clermont retired permanently in the abbey of Manlieu, where he died in 710. According to some uplifting stories of the thirteenth century, St.. Bonet saw the Virgin in 684 or 700, while praying alone in a church dedicated to St Michael. Sausseret reprints the facts reported in the bottom of a letter: \"the guards closed the doors. St. Bonit, full of joy for a chance to give free rein to his mercy from that moment, lay prostrate on the floor of the bathroom of the temple with his tears. But as soon as he had been in this position, you feel suddenly come down from heaven and filled with the sounds of harmony. He saw, at the same time, all heavenly choirs fill the sacred area with this light and enter a multitude that his faith had blessed him with. There were, in fact, legions of angels and saints, who composed a the procession for their Queen, mother of Jesus Christ, who appeared after them, seated on a throne carried by seraphim and similar to a queen that a large honor guard precedes and accompanies [...] All these immortal beings continued along the main nave and when they came in front of 'main altar, some of them asked who among them would say the mass. Then the Blessed Virgin spoke up and said, 'Here Bonit, we seek you my faithful servant and excellent bishop, and worthy of fulfilling this holy function \" Some blessed then, obeying the order that she had just given detachment from others and went to the holy bishop who was trembling. Taken by the hand,he accompanied the choir. The saints clothed him in a pontifical ornaments and then he began to say mass with glorified beings as assistants [...] When Mass was over, the Holy Virgin, left him.>> (I, 118-120). Reliable historical sources are almost non-existent: Sausseret cites the reports of Surius, which in turn is based on oral testimony of two successor to Bonet.",

The girl apparently was able to complete the task and as in Castellammare de Stabia the excavation was very fruitful and indeed miraculous, volunteers soon striking something that gave forth a metallic sound. Digging deeper they uncovered a bronze bell. Within its cavity was the promised statue, which depicted Mary in a standing position with the Infant as usual on her left arm, His little hands fondling her right one.

The first night they rested at a certain village, where Abbot John had the following vision in a dream. It seemed to him that he was in the monastery at Byland when he saw a Lady, nobly dressed, and of surpassing beauty, holding by Her left hand a little Boy, who plucked a bough from a little tree that stood in the center of the cloister quadrangle, and then they both vanished. After this the abbot and monks set forth, but not knowing their way, the abbot proposed that they should recite their Office. Having done so, the Lady and Her Son re-appeared, and the abbot begged Her to lead them to Joreval. Then looking at Her Son, She said, \"Sweetest Son, for the love Thou hast ever had for Me, be a guide to these brethren.\" Then the Child held out the branch He had picked from the cloister of Byland, and said, \"Follow Me,\" and they did so, walking through rough and hard ways without any difficulty. And a number of little birds, snowy white, flew down on to the bough the Child held, and there sang the hymn, Benedicite omnia opera Domini Domino, whereby they were much refreshed, and at last they reached a wild uncultivated spot, where the Child planted His branch in the earth with the birds singing upon it, and said, \"Here God will soon be invoked and adored.\" And it seemed as though the whole land grew into a great tree covered with white singing birds. Then the Child disappeared. Abbot John then awoke, and with his companions proceeded on his journey much consoled. The monks were all clothed in white, and everyone asked, \"Who are all these men in white going by?\" Then Abbot John heard one reply: \"They are monks moving from Byland to Joreval.\" Another gazed at the firmament and stars for a while, and then, as if he had received a revelation, said, \"These good monks have come at a happy moment; they will, within a brief space, attain to much prosperity, and have abundance of all things necessary.\" Abbot John was much rejoiced at these words and proceeded on his way. This legend was known to everyone in those parts and often retold.",

The saint in 1316 married the noble lawyer Ulf Guidmarsson and had eight children with him, including the future St. Catherine of Sweden. For her religious devotion and her charity, Bridget soon became highly esteemed. After a journey of pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela (Spain), her husband retired to a Cistercian monastery and died there a year later (1344). This meant a turning point in the life of Bridget: She settled in and received revelations from Jesus Christ and the Holy Virgin Mary there. During this period of contemplation, Bridget became a mystical bride of Christ. Through a revelation, she was ordered to found a new religious order. In fact in 1346, through the work of Bridget, the monastery of the Brigidine Order. After a period of strict penance and prayer, she went to Rome in 1349 to obtain the approval of the Order religious and attend the jubilee proclaimed in 1350. She stayed for the remaining twenty-three years of her life in Italy. In 1370, the pope gave Bridget ot approval to establish the monastic order of the Holy.Savior, which later became (1379) the Order of Saint Bridget (Brigidine), with monks and nuns. In 1372/73, she undertook a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The saint is considered among the greatest and the most mystical of medieval women, and was canonized by Pope Boniface IX in 1391. Among the many writings that Bridget has left us, her greatest is a praise of the virtue and the life of the Virgin Mary.",

Because of his physical condition, he wavered but was told not to worry. He struggled to fulfill his mission, and when he reached the top he stopped to gather his strength. It was at that point that he felt a strange tingling in his leg. He rose as a new person and ran to tell his parents carrying the crutch he no longer needed. There are many wondrous stories of Our Lady of Montenero and many miraculous events attributed to her. Tradition also says that it was through her intercession that the city was saved from the devastation of an earthquake on January 27, 1472. Then there was the miraculous wind that saved the city from invasion launched by Emperor Maximilian I in 1496 and her deliverance of the city from a plague in 1720. In thanksgiving for the latter, all the Leghorn Bills of Health down through the year 1859 bore the image of the Madonna of Montenero. She is also credited with saving St. Paul of the Cross, founder of the Passionists, whose ship was floundering off the coast as he made his way to Pisa in 1750. The shrine of Our Lady atop the mountain looking down on Leghorn is a very popular pilgrimage destination. Especially attracted to the shine are young, unmarried women who, on the eves of Marian feast days, cast garlands of flowers before her solitarily unique and engrossing image. The painting depicts the Blessed Mother seated with the Jesus on her left knee. A small bird rests on her right forearm singing. (Also see the title Virgin with Garland.)",

She turned immediately after this gradually, but remained a sign of disapproval on the face of the Mother of God. The archbishop told this episode only at the time of his death, adding that this event changed his life and since then he had wanted to dedicate himself only to the service of God.

The gap kept growing; it is said that the world will end when a hay wagon can pass through. In the 1600s, Clarissan nuns built the church of St. Mary of the Snow over the Holy Stone. A nearby chapel houses a healing spring. In 1949 Communist authorities closed the church and repurposed it as a collective farm granary, then as a military warehouse. Its Baroque fittings were looted, its stucco decorations used for target practice, its convent ruined and demolished. Following the 1989 Velvet Revolution, an international effort by German, Austrian, and Czech believers restored the church and chapel and renovated the statue, which had been moved to another church for safekeeping. The annual pilgrimage on the Sunday after August 5, feast of Our Lady of the Snows, which resumed in 1991, features mass in Czech and German, followed by a picnic.",

Rosary and knelt in front of a happy \"Capital\" of the Virgin Mary, located at the intersection of the roads for Motta, Oderzo and Redigole. Even the morning of March 9 the Cigana, going to work, he stopped there to pray, and then continued on his way. But soon he stopped, struck by a marvelous vision: sitting quietly on the green wheat in a field, there was a beautiful young girl, dressed in white. Between the old and amazed the mysterious girl, he played a simple and friendly dialogue, then when the Cigana knew it was the Holy Virgin, fell to his knees, as if shot and sat in silence. So in the fresh morning sounded the voice of Madonna full of sadness and pity. She ordered Cigana to fast with the family for three Saturdays and preach fasting and repentance to all the people of Motta and the towns and villages of the land trevisana: Who had fasted with true repentance, he would have received mercy and forgiveness from the Lord, angry for too many sins of the people. To then leave an indelible memory of his beloved land of apparitions in Motta, the Virgin ordered that in that place was to be built a church. Hierzenberger 1996 p 114",

According to what is handed down, the girl, the daughter of peasants, was carrying grazing his cows when at one point he saw the Madonna. She would say \" Autilia, I have chosen to one of the highest business you make will in my name, led by Count Enrico Orsini, in Nola, and tell him that under that bush to the right of my hand, there is a buried my image, for many centuries; I want it to dig the earth and you are building a temple in my honor . \" She went from the count, Autilia was not believed. The next day there was a second appearance in the same place, and this time the face of the youth was marked by a ray of light. Returned the count, this time it was taken seriously, and with the cooperation of Bishop Monsignor Bruno, excavations were undertaken in the place indicated by Our Lady. Here he was found a painting depicting the Virgin between two angels, which was identified as the Immaculate Queen of Victories. Along with the painting he was found a bell weighing about forty pounds, storied inscription \"SS. NICOLAS, Confessor CHRISTI, MARIA VIRGO NOW Pronobis, KAROLUS DEI GRATIA REX SICILIAE\". According to some sources, the Carlo mentioned in the inscription would be Charles II of Anjou , who, after some victory in battle, he would build there a chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas of Bari and the Madonna. Painting and bell would then belong to this ancient building of the thirteenth century [1] . The events of those days were an important event in the history of Liveri, that since then begins a journey to the Marian city, which extends to date [2] . The site of the apparitions became the site of construction of a number of religious structures sovrappostesi over time, and resulted in the current Sanctuary of Santa Maria a wall . In honor of the apparitions, the shrine was placed an inscription that reads still visible [3][4] : DOM Deiparae VIRGINI DECEASED OLIM IMAGO SUB TERRA SEPTA VEPRIBUS Autilia SCALE INDICATING THE DIVINE MONTI, miraculis LATE CLARUIT ET WALL, IN QUO PICTA EST NOMEN habuit YEAR AB EILSDEM VIRGINIS partu MDXIV Pidie IDUS apr?lis [5] About three months after the apparitions Autilia died.

She took pity on him, returned in haste to the castle to collect the necessary food, which she gladly gave to the beggar. Her errand had delayed her and she rushed off without further ado. Then she was still two miles from the church, she heard the sound of the bells-it was already the time of the elevation. She knelt down piously and as she stood up she \"saw the Virgin in a dim light\" holding Jesus' inert body in her arms. \"Look towards the church, my daughter. You will see from here the celebration of the Holy Mystery, as though you were actually present,\" she heard the Blessed Virgin say. Louise looked up and \"saw an illuminated altar and a priest raising the consecrated host\". Later, Louise had a shrine built on the site of the apparition. Since the middle of the 16th century, believers have venerated the Virgin at this shine as \"Our Lady of the Kneeler\". Miracle cures have been claimed and on September 11, 1908, Pius X granted a 300-day indulgence to all those who visited the shrine. Still today, the feast day of September 8th attracts hundreds of believers.",

Warns the clergy who is a solemn procession to honor and here, where now you see me, you have built a sanctuary. \" Stunned for the thrill, but proud for the assignment, Bertolino runs by the Governor of the city to tell him the message of Our Lady. But, as expected, both the Governor that some of the notables present, have a great time listening to the strange story, and when the farmer begins to insist that they follow him on the site of, the hunt in a bad way, and consider him a visionary. Quite miserable for the poor reception received, Bertolino he returns home, and the next day, early in the morning, he went again at the olive tree with the hope of seeing the bright image of the Virgin and to be able to trust all its bitterness. The Apparition back! With my heart in my throat, running along the last stretch of the climb, feels humiliated and offended, not because of the injuries received, but rather the failure of the mission played by Madonna. Come close to the tree, the Madonna is there waiting for him. Encourages and exhorts him to return by the Governor, but also the second embassy had greater success than the first. On the third day, Bertolino back in that place now so dear to him. He kneels down and waits to return the Apparition. The Virgin returns: gently and firmly encourages him to demonstrate to the Governor that what he says is true. Without hesitation, Bertolino returns to town. With courage, for the third time, relates how the Virgin commanded him, and insists that they all go up with him up the hill to check the veracity of his story. But this time the injuries plus the beatings. To better put him to trial, the present resort to violence. The miraculous spring Bertolino, from mild temperament, would have been overwhelmed if Madonna had not intervened to free him! Suddenly, who beats him with his arm remains paralyzed and mute. In the hall hangs a heavy silence! Everyone understands to be witnesses of a supernatural and each, in his heart, he asks forgiveness for the offenses committed against the poor Bertolino. The Governor shall convene the frightened pastor, the Canons, and all, in solemn procession, come at the place determined by Bertolino who, with hearts full of joy, leads the procession to the duke's palace miraculous place. All, trasecolati admire the vision, clear and distinct, the Virgin Mary, shining between radiance of dazzling light. And a great new gift store for them the Madonna, as tangible proof of the extraordinary and lasting event, at the foot of the olive is overflowing with a source of pure, fresh water, which still continues to the relief of many sick! The first miracle is the very man who has beaten Bertolino and made fun of him. Sincerely repented, regaining the word and the use of the arm. The news of the apparition spreads like wildfire and the place attracts a multitude of people to write down with water from the source to invoke mercy, protection and comfort.",

Tell everyone I want to be honored in this place and I'll let my little image fly by angels from Greece as a pledge of predilection. Fast on Saturday.\" John could not move the picture and left it on the mountain. On the way back, with some priests and faithful to see the picture they found a spring flowed where they had placed the feet of Mary. The priests took the picture in the Church, but he disappeared and was again found in the place of the apparition. This happened three times, and eventually left her permanently on the mountain. In December 1574 a ship from Ragusa, the current Dubrovnick, Dalmatia, docked in the port due to a violent storm. The captain and the sailors went to the shrine to thank the Virgin for saving them from the wreckage and were amazed to see the image as it was the same mysteriously disappeared from their land 17 years earlier. After many negotiations were able to take her away, but during the first night of navigation, the image disappeared and reappeared from the ship on the mountain. The Archbishop of Genoa ascertained the authenticity of the facts and on August 6, 1558, authorized the construction of the church and in July 1559 the sanctuary was opened for worship. The miraculous effigy, given by Our Lady to Rapallo in 1557, is set in a lovely pavilion silver and a bar of wood 18 cm by 13, which depicts the Dormition of the Virgin, Death and Assumption of the Virgin the sky. Below is represented the Virgin Mary dead, dressed in a dark robe and lying on a bed covered with a red cloth, and around, the apostles in prayer. Against the sky, there is the Holy Trinity, depicted as three distinct Persons, but together, almost joined to become one, and in the hands of the Holy Trinity where the Blessed Virgin Mary is located. The Holy Father Benedict XVI on the occasion of the 450th anniversary of the Apparition sent a letter to Mons. ALBERTO TANASINI, Bishop of Chiavari.",

He told the people of the apparition. And soon right on the spot where the Lady appeared a chapel was built. A town quickly flourished around it and was called \"Manaoag\". Tradition has it that the town itself was born from the Virgin Mary’s call, thus the term, \"taoag\" meaning \"to call\" was used to name the town. This is where the name Manaoag was derived from, which means \"She Calls\". During World War II, the Church suffered moderate damage. 4 bombs were released on top of the church. 3 bombs landed on the plaza and the facade, destroying them both. One bomb landed in the sanctuary, but failed to explode. The church was rebuilt, and today, it is an active parish serving Manaoag and the surrounding area.",

It is resolved, likewise, that it be given the title of Nuestra Senora de la Misericordia.\"",

The unexpected vision of something small in stature but radiating extraordinary brilliance from a hollow in the rocky landscape so bewildered the girl that she ran to tell her companion, and both fled terrified back to the town of Taal. Historian Jose M. Cruz, S.J., Ateneo de Manila University, reviewed original microfilm documents of the inquiry into the apparitions and reports that Church officials interrogated Catalina but she told them she could not clearly identify what she saw. Many people flocked to the area. Even without official church sanction, native devotion was quick and spontaneous. Miraculous healing powers were attributed to the waters from the spring. More than 30 people declared they saw visions of the Lady at Caysasay.",

It is considered an invaluable treasure inherited by the Caviteños, and is the oldest extant dated Marian painting in the Philippines. A legend narrates that many years ago, a small detachment of the Spanish Guardia Civil was stationed at a garita (little garrison, or sentry post) located at the end of the Isthmus of Rosario. One stormy night, a Spanish sentinel was at his post and he perceived a bright, shifting light. A dazzling apparition rose form the currents of Cañacao Bay, startling the sentry with suspicion that it could be pirates out to raid the port (at the time, Cavite was at the peak of economic prosperity because of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade). Frightened, the sentinel shouted, \"¡Alto! ¡Alto!\" (\"Halt! Halt!\"). Instead of stopping, the light proceeded toward him. Hence, in a loud voice he asked, \"¿Quién vive?\" (\"Who is there?\"). He then heard a sweet and melodious voice reply: \"Soldadito, ¿por qué el alto me das en noche tan fría? Dame paso. ¿No conoces a María?\" (\"Little Soldier, why halt me on a night so cold? Give me passage. Thou knowest not Mary?\") The sentinel, struck in awe and confusion, humbly and repentantly replied, \"Perdóname, Virgen María, Reina de mi devoción; pues solo soy un soldado que cumplo mi obligación!\" (\"Forgive me, Virgin Mary, Queen of my devotion; I am but a soldier that complies with my duty!\") The following morning, fisherman and workers at the Cavite Royal Arsenal passed through the Porta Vaga (Vaga Gate) and found a framed image of the Virgin on the beach along Cañacáo Bay near the place of her earlier apparition. They brought the image to the parish priest who temporarily installed it in the parish church. Later, a small chapel was built near the Porta Vaga's walls, and for three centuries it was the icon's shrine. The icon was used to bless the galleon plying between Cavite and Acapulco, Mexico during formal sending off ceremonies, earning her the title \"Patroness of the Galleon.\"",

She took the name Veronica and had a difficult novitiate because of the severity of her superiors. She is said to have had numerous mystical experiences, including several visions of Our Lord in which she received the stigmata, including those of a crown of thorns on her head. The bishop, in an effort to rule out the possibility of fraud, subjected her to many more trials. She was not allowed to be alone for one moment and she was forbidden to receive Holy Communion. She was not allowed to talk with any of the sisters except those assigned to watch over her, and she was not allowed to communicate with the outside world. Her hands were put into gloves with the fastenings sealed with the bishop's signet. She served as mistress of novices for thirty-four years and abbess for ten, leaving behind a ten-volume spiritual diary. Veronica died on July 9, 1727, and was canonized in 1839. Her feast is not on the General Roman Calendar, but it is celebrated by the Franciscans on this day.",

Living among the sisters, she discovered the peace of the cloister, and, on the occasion of her first communion, she realized the depth of her mystical consciousness of the conflict between the peace of God and the turbulence of the world. She was often ill, immobilized by rheumatism, making?a vow to the Virgin to become \"one of her daughters', if she were healed. These years of suffering prepared her sanctification. In June 1671, after overcoming many obstacles of a practical nature, Margaret Mary Alacoque recovered and kept her promise to the Mother of God and entered the convent of the Visitation at Paray-le-Monial. The convent that she chose was living in conformity to the thought and the inspiration of Francis de Sales. Margaret became a chosen one of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom he received great graces. The mystic nun was one of the most fervent ambassadors of the message of the Sacred Heart of Jesus",

In 1868 Anna joined the Order of the Dominicans and took the name Marie Claire Dominic of the Holy Cross. It was considered as a soul atoning for the reform of the religious order. Sister Marie Dominic had the grace of spiritual and mystical experiences (appearances of God, Angels and Saints). Because of these visions was accused by several parties to be deception and fraud, even by her confessor, who for twelve years did not believe. Finally, a bishop's court decided in her favor in 1884. For all that time she had remained obedient to the ecclesiastical authority, and had endured the suspicion and slander as an exercise in humility. She founded a convent on Mount Limpert in Clairefontaines and one in Luxembourg. She died in 1895. The cause of beatification was initiated in 1915.",

In 1907 Father Constantino Guanella recounted to his nephew: \"It is as if you had seen in a movie thater all that you should have done.\" This dream at nine years of age was determinant for all his other options. This mystical encounter marked him profoundly. Our Lady also appeared to St. John Bosco when he was nine years old to show him his land of mission: young people. The founder of the Servants of Charity and the Daughters of St. Mary of Providence created a religious family modeled on the family of Nazareth, and called to follow a simple two-part program for sanctity: to pray and suffer.",

Inspired by these visions, the seer founded an orphanage in 1884 and in 1899 a community of Third Order of St. Dominic, which she led as prioress. Because of disobedience against the bishop of Metz Willibrord Benzler OSB, this community was dissolved. The mystic received the gift of the Holy Stigmata, the supernatural authenticity, however, was questioned. Even Catherine's mystical experiences, which led Pope Leo XIII to promote the cult of the Holy Rosary, were never validated by ecclesiastical commissions. Hierzenberger 1997 p 225",

She was confused and frightened, and began to run away from the place. The voice called again, and this time Karmela realised that the voice was coming from within the chapel, she went inside and said her usual prayers. The voice which had come from the image of the Blessed Virgin asked her to recite three Ave Maria in honor of the three days Her body remained in the tomb before Assumption to Heaven. Karmela did as the voice asked and went on her way. Shortly afterwards Karmela fell ill and remained confined to her bed for more than a year. After this time, Karmela revealed her secret to a friend, Francesco Portelli, who in turn told her that about the same time he also heard a woman's voice asking him to pray from within the chapel. Shortly after this mysterious call Francesco's mother was miraculously healed by the intercession of Our Lady of Ta` Pinu. The lonely chapel became a place of pilgrimage for many people on the island and beyond. Bishop Pietru Pace was informed about these events and after speaking to Karmela and Francesco he concluded that the voice was of heavenly origins. Devotion to Our Lady of Ta` Pinu grew rapidly, and numerous pilgrimages flocked to the chapel.",
